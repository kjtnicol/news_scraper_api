0,Khashoggi murder: Turkey gives official details of Saudi writer's death - BBC News,http://www.bbc.com///news/world-europe-46049204,2018-11-01 09:45:52,Europe,http://www.bbc.com///news/world/europe,"Turkey has given its first official statement on how it believes Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi was killed, saying he was immediately strangled. The statement follows weeks of media reports about the murder at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October. Turkey has yet to provide evidence.  Chief prosecutor Irfan Fidan said meetings with his Saudi counterpart this week led to ""no concrete results"".  Saudi Arabia has not commented on the meetings. The Turkish statement said: ""In accordance with plans made in advance, the victim, Jamal Khashoggi, was choked to death immediately after entering the Consulate General of Saudi Arabia."" His body was then dismembered and destroyed ""again, in line with advance plans"", it added.  Khashoggi, a Saudi national working for the US press, was a well-known critic of his home country's rulers. His body has not been found, but Turkey, the US and Saudi Arabia have all agreed that he was killed at the consulate.   There is still no consensus on how he died.  Turkey said it had put three main questions to the Saudis during the prosecutor's visit: An unnamed Saudi official previously told Reuters news agency that Khashoggi's body had been rolled in a rug and given to a ""local co-operator"", who disposed of it.  On Wednesday, the delegation responded the questions in writing, according to Turkey.  Saudi Arabia said the answers could only come from a joint investigation. It also noted that it had never given an official statement on the existence of a ""co-operator"". Turkey has steered away from publicly blaming Saudi Arabia for the killing. However, a senior spokesperson from the ruling AK Party said on Wednesday that it could not have been carried out without orders from someone in a senior position. Saudi Arabia denies its royal family was involved.  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke to Saudi King Salman last week, and the two agreed to continue co-operating in the investigation. Unnamed Turkish officials have previously told media outlets that they had audio and visual evidence to prove their accounts of the writer's death, but nothing has been released.  Turkish media have published details on how sources say Khashoggi was killed, including allegations he was tortured.   His Turkish fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, gave a tearful interview to local television last week, saying she would never have let her partner enter the consulate if she had thought that the ""Saudi Arabia authorities would hatch a plot"" to kill him. He had entered the consulate to sort out documents for their marriage.  Attorney General Sheikh Saud al-Mojeb met Mr Fidan twice, visited the consulate and spoke with Turkey's intelligence agency during his visit to Istanbul this week. He flew back to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday without making an official statement.  Saudi Arabia has changed its account of what happened to Khashoggi.  When he first disappeared, it said Khashoggi had walked out of the building alive. It later admitted he had been murdered, saying the killing was premeditated and a result of a ""rogue operation"". Saudi Arabia has subsequently said that Khashoggi was murdered, and that it is ""determined to find out all the facts"". It has arrested 18 suspects, who, it says, will be prosecuted in Saudi Arabia. Turkey wants the suspects to be extradited. Saudi Arabia has faced backlash over the death, including from its allies, who have called for answers.   President Donald Trump has said he is ""not satisfied"" with the Saudi account. However, he also said he was unwilling to sacrifice lucrative arms deals with the country.  Meanwhile, US activists have launched a petition, calling for a section of road near the Saudi embassy in Washington to be renamed Jamal Khashoggi Way. On Wednesday, France's foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Khashoggi's death was a ""crime"" and ""odious"".  He said France was not ""dependent on our economic relations with Saudi Arabia"" and the country would impose sanctions, but no details were given.  UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt also said it was an appalling act, adding that it had ""possibly"" given the US and the UK a chance to put new pressure on Saudi Arabia over other issues.  Earlier in the day, the US called for a swift cessation of hostilities in Yemen, where a Saud-led coalition has been fighting local Houthi rebels. "
1,Mystery surrounds deaths of Saudi sisters found in New York - BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46039480,2018-11-01 05:54:22,World,http://www.bbc.com///news/world/us_and_canada,"Police in New York are investigating the deaths of two sisters from Saudi Arabia who were found duct-taped together in the Hudson River last week. Tala Farea, 16, and Rotana Farea, 22, were discovered facing each other and fully clothed without any obvious signs of trauma, police say. Investigators say it is too early to determine if any crime occurred or if their deaths were caused by suicide. The girls had recently applied for US asylum, police said. The Farea sisters moved from Saudi Arabia to Fairfax, Virginia, in 2015 with their mother, and had a history of running away from home, according to US officials. But investigators say it remains a ""puzzle"" as to how they came to be found dead on a riverbank more than 250 miles (400km) from their family's home. The Saudi Consulate General said in a statement that embassy officials had contacted their family, and added that the sisters were students ""accompanying their brother in Washington"". The Associated Press, citing New York police, said that the day before their bodies were discovered, their mother received a call from an official at the Saudi embassy ordering the family to leave because the girls had applied for political asylum. The girls were discovered in Riverside Park last Wednesday wearing black leggings and black jackets and with duct-tape around their waists and ankles.  Police had originally theorised that the girls may have jumped from the George Washington Bridge, but ruled that out after finding a lack of obvious injuries which they would have sustained in the fall. After releasing sketch drawings of the sisters, police were able to identify them on Friday, and are now seeking the public's help in learning more about their lives in the New York metro area in the past two months. At a press conference on Wednesday, the city's chief of detectives said there are some ""gaps"" in the sisters' history, which investigators are trying to resolve.  ""I'm confident that when the complete investigation is done we'll have a good idea of what exactly transpired,"" said Detective Dermot Shea."
2,BBC - Travel - The island that never stops apologising,http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20181031-the-island-that-never-stops-apologising,,Travel,http://www.bbc.com/travel,"Yun-Tzai Lee and Joanne Chen are one of those sickening couples that finish each other’s sentences, lace their fingers together and just won’t stop oozing adorable. But the three little words ‘I love you’ don’t come as easily to Lee as they do to his fiancée Chen. His face turns beetroot-red at the thought of uttering the phase, and causes him to feel ‘buhaoyisi’ (pronounced ‘boo-how-eee-suh’) – one of the many ways to feel mortified or to be sorry in Taiwan.   “Most people here will feel this way,” Lee said. Welcome to the linguistic minefield of apologising in Taiwan, where simply saying ‘buhaoyisi’ can open a Pandora’s Box of profuse politeness. The word is made up of four characters that literally translate to ‘bad meaning’ or ‘bad feeling’, and serves as a tidy catch-all that can be deployed in all kinds of situations, from meekly catching a waiter’s attention to expressing a guilt-ridden apology to your boss to the paralysing feeling that washes over you as you struggle to confess your love.  You may also be interested in:• The complex art of apology in Japan• Where being nice is the law• The country that loves to give Buhaoyisi is forever on the lips of Taiwanese, according to Prof Chia-ju Chang, Chinese professor at Brooklyn College City University of New York. “We use it all the time as Taiwan is a verbally polite culture. So, we use it when we interrupt people or asking of a favour. We can even use it to start a conversation.” Buhaoyisi is often spoken so fast that it comes out as a slurry of consonants that sounds like gibberish to the unsuspecting ear. And unlike ‘Entschuldigung’ in German or ‘excuse me’ in English, translating ‘buhaoyisi’ is no simple task, says Ouyu Yang, a teacher at National Taiwan University’s Chinese Language Division. The Western notion of ‘sorry’ is far too limited to express all the social graces and good form that weigh down on this loaded expression; buhaoyisi can also be a feeling, a sensation, a code of conduct and a whole system of thought that permeates Taiwanese culture.  The Western notion of ‘sorry’ is far too limited to express all the social graces and good form that weigh down on this loaded expression  Ride the subway in Taipei and you’ll hear a cacophonous chorus of ‘buhaoyisi’ as passengers gingerly nudge past others in humble deference. Enter a classroom, and you’ll see students start and end each question with ‘buhaoyisi’, dripping with a sense of indebtedness and gratefulness even as the discussion continues. Open an email, and the first line will usually be ‘Buhaoyisi’ – implying ‘sorry to slightly bother you’ – even for the smallest of favours. And if a dear cousin gives you a gift, the correct response isn’t ‘thank you’, but rather, ‘buhaoyisi’ for the inconvenience I’ve caused you. For the uninitiated outsider, Taiwan may seem like the world’s most apologetic country, a nation obsessed with saying sorry – but in fact, the culture of buhaoyisi reveals a lot about the islands’ hidden layers of modesty and shyness.  Decades of Japanese colonisation, as well as moral teachings of Confucianism, have played a huge hand in shaping Taiwan’s extreme apology culture to what you see and hear today, according to Khin-huann Li, sociolinguistics professor emeritus at National Taiwan Normal University. Although the phrase’s exact origins are unknown, Li and other linguists theorise that it is largely a product of the millennia-old Confucian notion of harmony, which centres on maintaining interpersonal relationships rather than individual ones. Preserving social cohesion at all costs is still the bedrock of Taiwan’s social morality; placing the larger clan, the society, before yourself, the individual, is key. In addition, part of Taiwan's buhaoyisi culture is heavily influenced from Japan’s sumimasen apology culture, with the two sharing a deep history.  Overall, as a habit, saying buhaoyisi often helps confrontations from escalating further, Li said. “Traditional Taiwanese culture is like that – more delicate and thinking of other people, trying to keep polite relationships with others,” he explained.  On the one hand, the expression carries an air of submissiveness and hyper decorum, but on the other hand, it also demonstrates the unparalleled politeness of Taiwan. That's why, for the traveller, saying sorry in Chinese can easily turn into a linguistic minefield. When in doubt, Li says, err on the safe side and just say buhaoyisi; chances are they’ll say buhaoyisi back to you. It’s the unspoken rule on the islands of Taiwan. Li also suggests that this culture of buhaoyisi is unique to Taiwan, as opposed to the rest of the Chinese-speaking world; while you'll hear buhaoysi many times over throughout the streets of Taiwan, you are less likely to hear buhaoyisi being used in this way in China or Malaysia, which place less emphasis on such polite-isms.  When in doubt, err on the safe side and just say buhaoyisi  According to InterNations’ Expat Insider Index, Taiwan is consistently ranked as one of the world’s friendliest countries. Around 90% of expats in Taiwan gave residents high marks for hospitality, compared to a combined average of 65% in the rest of the surveyed countries. Nowadays, more than one-third of expats are considering staying on the tiny Pacific island forever, according to the survey of 12,500-plus respondents around the world. The secret to attracting people to the lush, tropical islands of Taiwan is really no secret at all – just be, well, nice. However, according to 25-year-old pharmacist Jieru You, who lives in the port city of Kaohsiung, this nice, little narrative that Taiwan is leading the world in friendliness may be a false one, or at least not the full picture. Having to make yourself smaller and apologise constantly for small inconveniences, and sometimes even your mere presence, can ultimately do more harm than help. And ironically, asking permission to do, to speak, to come and to go all the time can be unnecessarily inconveniencing yourself more than anyone else. “When making a request to someone else, Taiwanese people will often use buhaoyisi as a lead-in to express their desire to ask for help from a place of humble submission,” You said. As a matter of fact, he was already feeling a bit ‘buhaoyisi’ – embarrassed to be interviewed at all – before diving into his thoughts.  The concept of ‘saving face’ is a big deal in Taiwan. Imagine a chessboard of social exchanges, in which everyone else’s moves affects your next one. Face, in this case, is the social currency that allows you to make friends and foster professional connections that can lead you to your next big job, an investment in your company or even a warm introduction to your future wife. Without ‘face’, people are less likely to trust you or help you get ahead in life. The end game is to protect yourself, your self-image and your dignity and curry favour with others by reciprocating their acts of kindness. That’s why Taiwan is confrontation-averse; it’s a country constantly striving to avoid conflicts and preserve harmony at all costs. But what happens when fiercely following that moral compass goes awry? You just might get something akin to Taiwan’s conundrum of over-apologising.  The end game is to protect yourself, your self-image and your dignity  On the flipside, people with ‘thin face’, meaning a lack or loss of your social reputation and status, try not to trouble others for fear of inconveniencing them, and they certainly don't like to lose face in public, adds Yang. So instead of standing up, everyone sits down and stays there while little gets done. Yang feels like she’s drowning in a pool of too many perfunctory apologies, in which saying buhaoyisi is more of a habit than a word with deeper meaning. The result is half-hearted, stripped of any sincere apology or regret. Not to mention, thanks to the island’s growing global isolation and economic malaise, Taiwanese are suffering from the poetically named syndrome of guidao, or ‘ghost island’.  On the world stage, Taiwan’s identity is often misunderstood, says Wenhui Chen, informatics professor at Ming Chuan University, who studies the ghost-island phenomenon. He says that the island is often viewed as a pawn between China and the US, floating along without many of the diplomatic trappings of an officially recognised country. Chen predicts Taiwan’s apologetic, kow-towing culture may not prove so fruitful in the end, and could even lead to the society’s own undoing. Of course, not everyone bears such a doom-and-gloom forecast for Taiwan. Li, for his part, sees the island’s deep buhaoyisi culture as integral to keeping the peace – and if the culture of buhaoyisi disappears, then so will centuries of timeworn tradition. “If the society keeps these concepts and expresses these words daily, then the society could be more polite, more moral and more conservative,” Li said. “If not, the society becomes impolite, immoral and too aggressive. Taiwan’s culture [must] be kept in a good shape in terms of morality and harmony.” He then ended with the obligatory ‘buhaoyisi’.

3,French Ain babies: Missing limb births prompt national inquiry - BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46043564,2018-11-01 04:30:55,Europe,http://www.bbc.com///news/world/europe,"France has launched a national investigation into the number of babies being born with missing arms or hands - weeks after an initial inquiry closed. The first investigation began after it emerged more than a dozen children had been born with the condition in clusters in three French regions. It ended after health authorities failed to identify a common cause. But now another 11 cases have emerged in the eastern region of Ain, prompting officials to open a fresh inquiry. The condition is a type of agenesis, where the upper limbs of a foetus fail to form correctly during pregnancy.  It includes entire missing upper limbs, missing forearms and hands, or fingers - but not unrelated medical conditions, such as missing thumbs. The cases are clustered in the rural Ain area not far from the Swiss border, as well as in Brittany and Loire-Atlantique, two neighbouring regions on the north-west coast. Health Minister Agnès Buzyn had already pledged a further investigation in the wake of the initial report's lack of explanations, amid continued public concern and widespread media coverage. Speaking on French television on Wednesday morning, she said the first results from the national inquiry would be published in January, with more to follow by summer. ""I think all of France wants to know,"" said Ms Buzyn. ""We don't want to rule anything out. Perhaps it's do with the environment, or something they ate, or something they drank. Perhaps it's what they breathed - right now I just don't know."" All the cases reported in Ain involve people within a 17km (11 miles) radius of the village of Druillat, leading to speculation about the possible influence of pesticides - which has yet to be proven.  The stories of some affected children were widely covered in the French media in the wake of the first report. Ryan, now aged eight, is one of the children from the Ain region who is missing a hand. His parents told French news channel Franceinfo that there had been no hint of a problem on ultrasound scans. Instead they found out when he was born, and doctors were unable to tell them why.   Another affected mother, from Brittany, said she was quizzed by doctors after the birth of her son Leo with a malformed forearm.  They wanted to know about eating habits or any pharmaceuticals of drug use - but again, could not find a cause. Chair of the scientific committee in Ain's regional health centre, geneticist Dr Elizabeth Gnansia, said the number of concentrated cases of a rare condition was significant. ""Let's imagine they are born between 2009 and 2014, which is five years, can you imagine that in a small rural school seven infants are in the same school with a type of amputation of forearm?"" she said. ""We don't need statistics for that. It's highly significant. It's 50 times what you expect."" The regional register for birth defects, Remera, had raised concerns about a possible surge in cases in Ain in July, following reports from local doctors. It discovered seven cases clustered close together around Druillat over six years. But an initial report from Public Health France in October concluded that those cases, between 2009 and 2014, were not significantly higher than the national average.  However, it now says that the 11 new cases it uncovered were all from Ain, covering 15 years since 2000.  Three other cases in Loire-Atlantique and four in Brittany were also looked at. In those cases, the health body acknowledged that the numbers were higher than average - but again, no common cause was found. Officials concluded that in all three regions, further investigations were not possible without a hypothesis to pursue.  The report also said that monitoring of birth defects was only carried out by a handful of registers, covering just 19% of births in France. That has prompted some fears that the number of cases may be under-reported. On Tuesday, Public Health France announced that the new cases had  been uncovered by a further analysis of hospital databases. It warned that a comprehensive survey several years after the birth of affected children would be ""complex"". The case has drawn parallels with the Thalidomide scandal, involving a drug often taken by pregnant women to alleviate morning sickness. The link between Thalidomide and limb malformation during pregnancy was only uncovered after years of the drug's use. However, no such link between a chemical or pharmaceutical cause has been drawn in France."
4,Waco cult: How David Koresh persuaded 30 Britons to join - BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46039014,2018-11-01 07:41:38,US,http://www.bbc.com///news/world/us_and_canada,"The world watched as a compound in Waco, Texas, became a horrific fireball. Inside the burning building were cult leader David Koresh and scores of his followers. Twenty-five years on, relatives of the British victims reflect on what happened. Koresh became infamous as the self-styled prophet who thought he was the new Christ. His followers were in thrall to him, and remarkably, 30 of them were British. Only six of them survived. They came from the streets of Manchester, London and Nottingham - outwardly ordinary young people in their 20s and 30s. History has largely forgotten them. These are their stories. Her sister Gail cherishes memories of a lively girl about town: ""I used to call her 'rent-a-crowd', because she always had a gang of girls around her. She loved Van Halen, and she loved soul music - she and her friends would go to gigs all round the country.""  Bernadette Monbelly was well liked at work, as a training supervisor in a bank. A vibrant young woman enjoying the social life and clubs of 1980s London. One day a leaflet came through the sisters' door - it was an invitation to the local Seventh Day Adventist Church, where many of the congregation, like Gail and Bernadette, were either first or second Windrush generation. Gail and Bernadette both took up the offer.  Bernadette fell in with a group preaching radical Christian theology in their own small circle, away from the main church services - and there was talk of a man in Texas who knew the secrets of the final judgement day. Bernadette hadn't been feeling right - her health had taken a downward turn, and as her sister remembers, it lowered her guard enough for their influence to overtake her. ""These people started enveloping her. They were always at her place, day and night. And I told her, 'Bernadette who are these people?' And she said 'They're helping me'. And that was when the paths started to separate."" The man in Texas they were referring to was David Koresh. The reason they were talking about him was that he had actually visited England with his right-hand man - scouting for members who would join his budding sect. It's understood that David Koresh came to England around 1988 along with his trusted lieutenant - a man called Steve Schneider. They sought a fertile recruiting ground for their message of the imminent coming of the apocalypse, or ""Revelation"" as it is depicted in the Bible. Koresh himself had been rejected from the Seventh Day Adventist Church in Texas. So he knew that his starting point in England would be there.  He gave talks at a Seventh Day Adventist college in Berkshire called Newbold, without permission, and kept his identity a secret from its staff.  It was there that three students had their lives changed forever. From there, the power of Koresh's message on their minds would ripple out to families across England.  At the time, one of these students was dating a Manchester girl called Diana Henry.  She was from a large family of five brothers and sisters; her father was a bricklayer in Old Trafford.  Diana had just finished her degree in psychology when her boyfriend sold her Koresh's message of a utopian life at his Texas commune.  As her father Sam remembers: ""Her boyfriend wasn't a flippant lad, he was a serious lad. And so she thought well, if that's what he says, it's got to be right. She was hooked. She dropped her studies and would have followed this man anywhere."" Diana would make several visits to Waco, slipping away during term time to meet David Koresh without her father's knowledge, before coming back to Manchester one last time. Sam remembers how on that occasion she became instrumental in spreading Koresh's message herself.  She organised meetings in a semi-detached house in a Manchester suburb called Cheetham Hill at which dozens of young people attended.  Koresh's lieutenant was there, giving a charismatic talk, and saying ""he needed to take his instructions from God"". He was talking, of course, about Koresh. A local Seventh Day Adventist elder, George Taylor, recalls being at the clandestine meetings.  ""I remember turning to my wife and saying: 'This is strange. This is not right.'"" His wife, Dimplets, recalls a packed room. ""There were people standing, sitting on window ledges, in corners, and they were about an urgent business. And when I tried to interrupt the speaker to ask questions, they were like 'Woooah! Why are you challenging this man?'""  George Taylor saw what was happening to Sam's daughter Diana. He tried to change her mind - to stop her from being seduced into the would-be prophet's message. His pleas fell on deaf ears. In time, Sam Henry would make a frantic journey to Waco to try and convince her to return. There he confronted David Koresh himself: ""He tried to convince ME to stay there as well. He said come here - the authorities will never find you. He tried everything. ""I said we must leave, you must leave this place! But she didn't listen. None of them listened."" Sam had to return to Britain without his daughter. But worse was to come. Diana had in fact convinced her mother and four siblings to also leave their father and journey to join her at the commune in Waco, not long after.  None of his family would return alive.   The cult spreads in Britain Back in Britain - in Nottingham - Devon Elliott was trying to talk his sister out of going over to Waco. A cheerful, gentle man in his mid-50s, one would never assume that he more than many others suffered the most terrible pain of Waco. ""I lost my sister, her fiance, my auntie, my cousin-in-law, and a very close friend."" They had each been entranced by Koresh's message at Newbold College.   Devon remembers his sister Beverly's wonderful singing voice and sense of fun. '""I wish I had recorded her singing years ago,"" he says. ""Some people from London had come up to Nottingham, trying to have meetings, chats. Obviously they'd got wind of some theology which wasn't really sound. But it was just like me going to my mates to watch the football - nobody really looked into it any. ""In hindsight, if I knew she was going to go, I would have cut her passport up. I would have,"" he remembers. He didn't know that she really meant to carry out her plan.  Instead, he had to watch on helplessly as communication with the cult commune was lost; how the FBI eventually surrounded the building, fearful of Koresh's stockpile of weapons; and how a growing sense of unease would become a national - and international - tragedy.  ""To me this was like being in a film. My life became all about just watching this white building. And at one moment you just see it all crash. And I'm thinking… my sister's in there. My aunty is in there. People that I love dearly are in there,"" Devon says. Koresh's offer to the Britons was a seductive one. They'd mainly come from traditions well versed in the Bible. So he was pushing at an open door. The Revelation, or the Biblical description of the apocalypse, was at hand, he said.  He'd convinced them that he was the next messiah - one sent by God to lead those righteous souls that would be saved, and that would taste eternal life. He told the Britons that they would be among them. That they should go to lead a frugal life of prayer at his Texas ranch, preparing for the imminent end of days.  What he didn't tell them is that his version of the apocalypse would be armed with a massive stockpile of guns and ammunition - and that he was a serial sexual predator.  The FBI's attempt to release the cult members ended in a horrific fireball.   In a matter of minutes, 72 people died. Twenty-four were British. They had left cities and towns seeking a simple life, fulfilling Biblical prophecy. ""The 'wackos of Waco' were like you and me"" says Gail Monbelly as she remembers her sister Bernadette. She wants people to reconsider the memory of the 30 Britons who went there. As a senior British detective who investigated Waco also remembers, ""the problem is that they were all tarred with the same brush. And that was quite wrong. Responsibility for what happened at Waco lies with one man only. And that is David Koresh."" The stories of the Britons of Waco and their entrapment by Koresh is told in a new BBC Radio 5 Live Podcast, 'End Of Days' - available now on BBC Sounds."
5,Spinal implant helps three paralysed men walk again - BBC News,http://www.bbc.com///news/health-46043924,2018-11-01 05:21:12,Health,http://www.bbc.com///news/health,"Three paralysed men, who were told they would spend the rest of their lives in a wheelchair, are able to walk again thanks to doctors in Switzerland. An electrical device inserted around the men's spines boosted signals from their brains to their legs.  And it also helped damaged nerves in the spinal cord to regrow. The researchers hope that this unexpected bonus will enable some paralysed people ultimately to regain independent movement. BBC News has had exclusive access to the patients in the clinical trial, the results of which are published in the journal Nature. The first patient to be treated was 30-year-old Swiss man David M'zee, who suffered a severe spinal injury seven years ago in a sporting accident.  David's doctor said he would never walk again.  However, thanks to an electrical implant developed by a team at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), he can walk more than half a mile with the implant turned on. As I strolled with him on a cloudless sunny day in the foothills of the Alps overlooking Lake Geneva, he told me how the ability to walk, albeit for short periods under controlled conditions, had changed his life. ""To me it means a lot. I'm surprised at what we have been able to do. I think you've got to try the impossible to make the possible possible. It's a lot of fun - it feels really good,"" he said. David comes across as an overwhelmingly positive person, but after his injury he had some dark moments. All attempts at rehabilitation had failed, so he agreed to take part in a trial led by Dr Grégoire Courtine at EPFL.  Dr Courtine recalls David's determination to succeed.  ""I came with my daughter, Charlotte, who was one month old at the time. As we approached David, he looked her in the eye and said, 'I will walk before you'.  ""When Charlotte took her first step she was 14 months old, by which time David was walking by Lake Geneva.  ""He said to her, 'I have beaten you'.""  To Dr Courtine's surprise, the spinal implant did more than enable David to walk. ""What was completely unexpected was the spinal cord repair that we observed.  ""What we observed in animals is that it seems that the nerve fibres are regrowing and reconnecting the brain to the spinal cord,"" he said. David had his implant surgically inserted by one of Switzerland's leading neurosurgeons, Dr Jocelyne Bloch, from Lausanne University Hospital.  She told me that she was also astonished at David's improvement. David can now walk up to eight paces when his implant is turned off and this is the first time that this has been recorded in a chronic spinal injury. Out of the lab, in the real world, it is hard for David to walk more than a few paces. The signals from the implant soon become uncomfortable and so can't be used all the time.  The system is also expensive and not reliable enough to be used outside of the laboratory for day-to-day use, so it's far from a cure.  But, according to Dr Mark Bacon, executive and scientific director of the charity Spinal Research, it does show that paralysis can be reversed - at least to some degree. ""Whether, in its current form, it is a plausible option for patients, is doubtful,"" he said.  ""But it demonstrates we have a workable model of what is required to stimulate regeneration and that, ultimately, paralysis is surmountable."" David is the first of three patients who have benefited from the first wave of the treatment.  Two other men have also managed to walk again, to varying degrees.  Gertan Oskan, a 35-year-old engineer from the Netherlands, was knocked over by a car seven years ago.  His doctors told him on his birthday that he would be paralysed for life. He is now beginning to regain some movement. Sebastian Tobler, a 48-year-old man from Germany, was a keen cyclist who loved being out in the countryside before he was knocked off his bike.  Now he's back on a specially adapted bike that is powered mostly by his hands - but also partly by his legs. The researchers believe that their system will improve and restore some movement to people who had lost all hope of walking again.  They plan to begin larger trials in Europe and the US in three years' time.  If these go well, the researchers hope the system could become more widely available. Follow Pallab on Twitter"

In a televised broadcast, Mr Khan said hardliners were ""inciting [people] for their own political gain"", claiming they are ""doing no service to Islam"". The landmark Asia Bibi case has already set off violent protests by hardliners who support strong blasphemy laws. Her lawyer has told the BBC she would need to move to abroad for her safety. Asia Bibi was convicted in 2010 after being accused of insulting the Prophet Muhammad in a row with neighbours.  She always maintained her innocence, but has spent most of the past eight years in solitary confinement. Wednesday's verdict by the Supreme Court triggered demonstrations in Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar and Multan. Clashes with police have been reported. A leader of the hard-line Islamist Tehreek-i-Labaik party, Muhammad Afzal Qadri, said all three Supreme Court judges ""deserve to be killed"". The Red Zone in the capital Islamabad, where the Supreme Court is located, has been sealed off by police.  Late on Wednesday, Mr Kahn said: ""Which government can function like this, blackmailed by protests?... ""And who suffers due to this? Our Pakistanis. The common people, the poor. You block the roads, you rob people's livelihood... ""This is not the service of Islam, this is enmity with the country. Only anti-state elements talk like this, that kill the judges, start a revolt in army... They are only trying to beef up their vote bank."" The trial stems from an argument Asia Bibi, whose full name is Asia Noreen, had with a group of women in June 2009.  They were harvesting fruit when a row broke out about a bucket of water. The women said that because she had used a cup, they could no longer touch it, as her faith had made it unclean.  Prosecutors alleged that in the row which followed, the women said Asia Bibi should convert to Islam and that she made offensive comments about the Prophet Muhammad in response.  She was later beaten up at her home, during which her accusers say she confessed to blasphemy. She was arrested after a police investigation.  Laws enacted by the British Raj in 1860 made it a crime to disturb a religious assembly, trespass on burial grounds, insult religious beliefs or intentionally destroy or defile a place or an object of worship, punishable by up to 10 years in jail. Several more clauses were added in the 1980s by Pakistan's military ruler Gen Zia ul-Haq: What are Pakistan's blasphemy laws? Blasphemy laws around the world The judges said the prosecution had ""failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt"". The case was based on flimsy evidence, they said, and proper procedures had not been followed. The alleged confession was delivered in front of a crowd ""threatening to kill her"". The ruling heavily referenced the Koran and Islamic history. It ended with a quote from the Hadith, the collected sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, which calls for non-Muslims to be treated kindly.  Islam is Pakistan's national religion and underpins its legal system. Public support for the strict blasphemy laws is strong.  Hard-line politicians have often backed severe punishments, partly as a way of shoring up their support base.  But critics say the laws have often been used to get revenge after personal disputes, and that convictions are based on thin evidence. The vast majority of those convicted are Muslims or members of the Ahmadi community, but since the 1990s, scores of Christians have been convicted. They make up just 1.6% of the population.  The Christian community has been targeted by numerous attacks in recent years, leaving many feeling vulnerable to a climate of intolerance.  Since 1990, at least 65 people have reportedly been killed in Pakistan over claims of blasphemy.  Asia Bibi, who was born in 1971 and has four children, was the first woman to be sentenced to death under the laws.   Internationally, her conviction has been widely condemned as a breach of human rights.    Authorities said she is scheduled for release later this week, after which her plans are unknown.  Speaking to the BBC, her lawyer Saiful Mulook said she would need to move to a Western country after the ruling for her own safety. She has been offered asylum by several countries and many expect her and her family to leave Pakistan.  "
7,Supreme Court chief justice once proposed to fellow judge - BBC News,http://www.bbc.com///news/world-us-canada-46039482,2018-11-01 08:25:35,US & Canada,http://www.bbc.com///news/world/us_and_canada,"Decades before serving together on the US Supreme Court two future judges were involved in a romance that led to a marriage proposal, a new book finds. Sandra Day O'Connor, the top court's first female justice, and former Chief Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist had dated in university back in 1949. The O'Connor family says the fact that the late justice had asked her to marry him was not well known. It was discovered in letters exchanged between the two top arbiters. Author Evan Thomas unearthed the proposal while he was conducting research for a biography of Mrs O'Connor called First, which will be published in March 2019. Mrs O'Connor, 88, who was nominated to serve on the Supreme Court in 1981 by President Ronald Reagan, was a ""study buddy"" with Rehnquist during their time at Stanford Law School, Mr Thomas writes. The two shared notes, and later dated, but had broken up by the time the future chief justice graduated and travelled to Washington to work as a clerk at the Supreme Court. The two remained close friends, however, all the way up to Rehnquist's death in 2005. Rumour has it that after joining the court in 1972, Rehnquist lobbied President Regan to appoint his old friend.  In a letter he sent to Mrs O'Connor in the early 1950s, shortly after Mrs O'Connor had begun dating her future husband, Rehnquist wrote to ask if they could discuss ""important things"". ""To be specific, Sandy, will you marry me this summer?"" Mrs O'Connor's son Jay told NPR - which first revealed the proposal - that he and his siblings were ""surprised"" to learn of the attempted engagement. But, he noted, it ""was a different era"" back then.  ""Dating was pretty innocent in the '50s,"" he said, adding that ""multiple men proposed to my mom when she was in college and law school, and ultimately my dad was the one who was the real deal"". According to the author of the biography, before Rehnquist died, he told a friend that his wife Nan was the only woman that he ever loved. Despite the rejection, Jay O'Connor called it an ""amazing accident of history that... my mom and her friend and law school classmate ended up on the Supreme Court together"". ""Not only did they have a wonderful working relationship for over 25 years on the court, they had a wonderful friendship their entire life."" Last week, Mrs O'Connor announced that she was withdrawing from public life after being diagnosed with dementia."
8,Chelsea 3-2 Derby: Blues win dramatic Carabao Cup tie to reach last eight - BBC Sport,http://www.bbc.com///sport/football/45961339,,Football,http://www.bbc.com///sport/football,"Chelsea knocked out Derby in the Carabao Cup fourth round as Frank Lampard's return to Stamford Bridge as a manager ended in a dramatic defeat. Five goals were scored in a frantic first half, including two own goals from Derby defenders Fikayo Tomori and Richard Keogh. The Championship side came from behind twice through Jack Marriott and Martyn Waghorn. But Cesc Fabregas slotted home four minutes before half-time for what proved to be the winner. Derby substitute David Nugent hit the inside of the post with a minute of normal time remaining but it rebounded safely into goalkeeper Willy Caballero's hands. Chelsea have been drawn at home to Bournemouth in a repeat of last season's quarter-final. The visitors had chances in the second half as Mount, Marriott and Keogh came close, while Chelsea's Gary Cahill was denied from close range and Alvaro Morata had a header saved by keeper Scott Carson. Before kick-off, a minute's applause was held in tribute to the victims of Saturday's helicopter crash at Leicester City. Former Foxes boss Claudio Ranieri - who managed Chelsea from 2000 to 2004 - was at Stamford Bridge. It was a big night for Chelsea's two on-loan players Tomori and Mount, who were given permission to face their parent club. Tomori's own goal after just five minutes - which deflected backwards off his standing leg as he attempted to clear Davide Zappacosta's cross - was greeted with encouragement from Lampard, who gestured to remain calm. Derby responded as Marriott coolly fired an equaliser into the far corner and, after Keogh's own goal - a deflection from another Zappacosta cross - they did so again when Mount turned provider for Waghorn.  Mount showed composure when he slid an inch-perfect ball across goal and he was impressive in the second half, twice coming close to scoring. Both loanees had a point to prove in front of Chelsea's staff and their displays certainly did that - and also showed how the loan system can be beneficial to the Blues.  Chelsea had 70% of the possession but Derby were no bystanders with seven shots on target to the hosts' five.  The side sixth in the Championship were a constant threat in the second half as Marriott's drive was tipped onto the top of the net and Mount went close with a powerful long-range effort. Keogh almost equalised in the 84th minute when Tom Huddlestone played a sublime ball over the top, while Nugent thought he had scored but saw his shot rebound off the inside of the post. But Fabregas' goal proved the winner as he took advantage when the ball ricocheted kindly from Chelsea right-back Zappacosta, who was involved in all of their goals.  Chelsea held on to deny Derby another shock win in this competition but it was still an emotional evening for Rams' boss Lampard. Lampard played 648 times for Chelsea and is the club's all-time leading goalscorer. Before the match, he said he would be ""proud and honoured"" to face a ""club that was his home for 13 years"". It has been a good start to management for Lampard as Derby sit just four points off the Championship leaders - and were unbeaten in five games coming into this tie. They also eliminated Manchester United in the third round, triumphing 8-7 on penalties at Old Trafford.  Lampard received a warm welcome from the home supporters as banners displayed the words ""forever a blue, forever a legend"" and his name was sung by Chelsea supporters shortly after Fabregas' goal.  He said he was ""a lucky man to have a night like that"" at full-time and was visibly emotional as he thanked supporters.  Chelsea assistant manager Gianfranco Zola: ""It was a tough game. Derby were excellent. They created us more problems. Our defence wasn't as good as other times. But most of the problems were created by them. ""We were in control until about 10-15 minutes to go. In those moments we thought about scoring too much. When you open up against a team with that quality, it is 50-50. We were lucky on occasions."" Derby boss Frank Lampard on Sky Sports: ""I'm disappointed. I think we deserved a draw on chances created. The difference between the sides was they scored three... actually we scored four, didn't we? I joke because I'm proud.  ""My players had to do really selfless stuff. Who goes through clear against Chelsea like we did on goal? We created chances. ""I'm so thankful to the Chelsea fans. I left through the back door and it upset me at the time but I have nothing but great memories of this place and they thank me like that. I'm a lucky man to have a night like that and I feel it."""
9,Paris Masters: Rafael Nadal out with injury & Roger Federer through - BBC Sport,http://www.bbc.com///sport/tennis/46042799,,Tennis,http://www.bbc.com///sport/tennis,"Rafael Nadal has withdrawn from the Paris Masters with an abdominal injury. It means Novak Djokovic, 31, will replace him as world number one when the rankings are released on Monday. The Serb will lead the rankings for the first time in two years, with Briton Andy Murray having taken top spot from him in Paris in November 2016. Earlier on Wednesday, world number three Roger Federer made it through to the last 16 without playing when Milos Raonic pulled out with an elbow injury. Djokovic, a 14-time Grand Slam champion, was ranked 21st going into this year's Wimbledon and will become the first player to be outside the world's top 20 and the world number one in the same season since Russia's Marat Safin in 2000. Spaniard Nadal, 32, was due to make his comeback after nearly two months out with a knee injury that led to him retiring from his US Open semi-final. ""I felt better than I thought I would one week ago but in the last few days I started to feel a bit in my abdominal, especially when I was serving,"" the French Open champion said.  ""I checked with the doctor and the doctor recommended that I did not play. ""It has been a tough year for me in terms of injury so I want to avoid drastic things. ""I have to think longer term. I want to keep playing tennis for a couple of years, so I have to do the logical thing."" The Spaniard has not made any decisions yet about whether he will play at the season-ending ATP Finals in London in November. Nadal's scheduled Paris opponent, 34-year-old Fernando Verdasco, will play Jack Sock in the next round after the American beat France's Richard Gasquet 6-3 6-3. Earlier, Kei Nishikori had a straightforward 7-5 6-4 victory over Adrian Mannarino and John Isner served up 33 aces as he beat Mikhail Kukushkin 6-3 6-7 (2-7) 7-6 (7-1).  Japanese 28-year-old Nishikori did not face a single break point as he defeated home crowd favourite Mannarino in one hour and 27 minutes to progress.  He will meet seventh seed Kevin Anderson or Georgian Nikoloz Basilashvili in the next round. On Court One, Isner's powerful serving ensured he was not broken at all but wasted opportunities meant he struggled to get past Kazakh Kukushkin. The American's serve only let him down at the second-set tie-break, as the world number 54 forced a deciding set. That went the distance too but this was a different story for Isner, who won early points against the Kazakh's serve to take the match. Isner needs to reach the semi-finals in Paris to have any hope of moving up to ninth in the rankings, which would give him a chance of making the ATP Finals. Later on Wednesday, Alexander Zverev beat Frenchman Frances Tiafoe 6-4 6-4. The pair traded missed break points in first set before the German, 21, won the final game on Tiafoe's serve. In the second set, Zverev broke three times but was broken twice as he wrapped up the eventful match in one hour and 44 minutes. Ninth seed Grigor Dimitrov is also through after beating Roberto Bautista Agut 7-6 (12-10) 6-4. BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller There is, as ever, huge sympathy for Nadal, who has this year missed nine events for a combination of ailments, and pulled out of a Grand Slam quarter-final and semi-final. He always does everything he can to compete at London's end-of-season ATP Finals, as he is acutely aware of how many he has missed. Last year he played through pain against David Goffin, before withdrawing from the tournament. Maybe this year he would be better to rest. Two years ago here in Paris, Djokovic lost to Marin Cilic in the quarter-finals and Andy Murray took the opportunity to replace him as world number one. The Serb's return to the top is a remarkable achievement when you consider his stunning defeat by Marco Cecchinato in the French Open quarter-finals. Djokovic then went hiking in the mountains with his wife Jelena, which seemed to clear his head. The world number 21 heading into Wimbledon, he has only lost once since and seems almost certain to be year-end number one for a fifth time."

14,World's longest DNA sequence decoded - BBC News,http://www.bbc.com///news/science-environment-46046024,2018-11-01 02:47:00,Science & Environment,http://www.bbc.com///news/science_and_environment,"A team of UK scientists have claimed the record for decoding the world's longest DNA sequence. The scientists produced a DNA read that is about 10,000 times longer than normal, and twice as large as a previous record holder, from Australia. This research has kick-started an Ashes-style competition to sequence an entire chromosome in a single read.  The new holder of the trophy for world's longest DNA read is a team led by Matt Loose at Nottingham University.  The advance is a technological one - this is about reading the DNA rather than the discovery of a particularly large genome. The DNA used for the long read came from a human. But the scientists hope the work will make it quicker and easier to sequence genetic information because, currently, DNA has to be chopped up into smaller pieces and then reassembled during the process of sequencing. Dr Loose's group also recently produced the most complete human genome sequence using a palm-sized ""nanopore"" sequencing machine. These potentially offer lower cost and faster processing for DNA sequencing. He told me: ""There has been a competition running to see who can get the longest sequence. I think it is still friendly.""  Dr Loose went on to say: ""Australia led for a while, but then we had a read just short of a million. People were then competing to beat the record, in particular to be the first person to get a million-base-pair read.  ""The friendly completion launched an Ashes style trophy that is supposed to travel around the world as people get the longest read."" An Australian team from the Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics was first to pass the million-base milestone. The technology that enables scientists to read runs of DNA sequences has come a long way since the millennium-era race to decode the first human genome.  In the past 10 or so years, improvements in DNA sequencing technologies have meant that the original billion dollar human genome from 2001 can now be replicated for around $1000.  As costs continue to tumble, there is an expectation that personalised DNA sequencing is not far away. We might soon have our genome decoded during a trip to the doctor's surgery, or more controversially, our parents might have it read for us, before we are even born.  But one of the remaining stumbling blocks is to put the DNA pieces together in the correct order. Just as it is theoretically possible, but quite unlikely, that a chimpanzee might reproduce a work of Shakespeare with one finger typing, computer programs are unable to re-assemble genomes from short, jumbled DNA sequences.  Dr Loose told me: ""There are lots of ways by which you can read DNA, but the problem is that the genetic code, or genome, is often many billions of bases, and so to read them all is very difficult.  ""People have used many different ways in the past, but essentially what they do is chop the DNA up into small pieces and then assemble them back together, a bit like what you would do with a jigsaw puzzle.  ""You try to get overlapping images so that you can find where the sky is and where the trees are and you can build your picture."" He explained: ""Nanopore sequencing promised lower cost and higher read lengths which means that we can look at interesting organisms which are yet to be sequenced, because their genomes are extraordinarily large."" Just as the scientists are competing to produce the longest DNA sequence, the technology companies are jostling to become market-leaders in delivering these new advances.  In the future, these methods promise to both revolutionise the understanding of human health, and also bring the same methods to other plants and animals. Long-read DNA sequencing might be used to identify pathogens in foodstuffs, be employed in disease control in animals, used for the diagnosis of infection, and find uses in a vast number of food-related areas. I asked Dr Loose about the excited references to ""whale-watching"" on social media.  ""We wanted a way of distinguishing long reads. What does 'long' mean? It used to mean reads of 300 bases instead of 150, then it meant 5,000. So we came up with the whale scale - a million base pair read would be equivalent to a whale of about a tonne in weight, like a narwhal.  ""The longest read that we have at the moment is a beluga whale"".  I asked him how long it will be before we have a ""blue whale"" read from a whole chromosome. Matt told me: ""It would be fantastic to sequence a whole chromosome, if that is possible. If we scale the nanopore up to the size of a human fist, then a megabase of DNA is a rope of 3.2 km, which you have to thread through your fingers without it getting tangled or breaking.  ""There is also a really interesting question of how many breaks each chromosome has. I am not sure you will ever be able to sequence a chromosome from one end to the other. Dr Loose said of the record-breaking read: ""In theory, nanopore sequencing allows you to sequence any length molecule of DNA. That's really quite different to how we have been sequencing DNA for many years now. The breakthrough in this paper is that we have been able to sequence a molecule of 2.3 million bases in length, which no one has ever been able to do before. ""Previously, the most common read length would be 150 bases [bases, or base-pairs, are the the four ""letters"" that make up the DNA sequence].  ""We were recently teaching people in Singapore how to use these sequencers at the same time as the grand prix. If the Singapore grand prix track is the same as 150 bases, then a 2.3 million base pair read is twice around the circumference of the earth"" he explained.   In November 2017, Dr Martin Smith from the Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics in Australia announced that they had a read over a million bases. According to Dr Loose, the Ashes trophy was being packaged to make the journey to Australia, just as Nottingham produced a winning 1.2 million base pair read. That has now been surpassed again by the Beluga-sized 2.3 million base pair read.  These advances did not go down too well in Australia, with Dr Smith jokingly responding with ""Loose sucks"" image, using a mock-up of the nanopore software.  Dr Loose hopes that we will start to use these methods to look at things like cancer genomes, where the DNA gets rearranged. Chromosomes break and they fuse back incorrectly.  In an interview, Dr Smith told me that the first record-breaking baby ""whale"" of 473,000 bases was from a cancer cell line.  His team is studying these patient-derived cancer cells because their genomes are particularly disordered, much like a jigsaw puzzle that is missing pieces and has parts from another puzzle. In the future, the methods will also be used more routinely in the clinic, in disease outbreaks, and moving out of labs and into individuals' hands.  I also asked both scientists how long they thought the current record will stand and who will take the trophy next. Both agreed that the record might last for a year or so, but disagreed on who might win, whether the UK, Australia or a newcomer.  With a friendly look, Dr Smith told me: ""Matt should sleep with one eye open, because talking about this long read stuff has made me thirsty for a record again. Keep an eye out, we are going to get that Ashes cup again one day."" Dr Angus Davison is a geneticist at the University of Nottingham and has been a BSA media fellow at the BBC."
15,Australian awarded house in 'bizarre' 20-year squatting case - BBC News,http://www.bbc.com///news/world-australia-46039642,2018-10-31 19:11:09,Australia,http://www.bbc.com///news/world/australia,"Two decades ago, Australian property developer Bill Gertos found a house sitting empty in Sydney. So he changed the locks, repaired the property - and began leasing it to tenants. Now Mr Gertos has won a legal battle to be declared the official owner of the house - which is estimated to be worth A$1.6m (£0.9m; $1.1m). It followed a court battle with descendants of its previous owner. Mr Gertos was granted ownership under a law recognising squatters' rights. Squatting is when someone occupies an empty or abandoned property which they don't own or rent, and without the owner's permission. In New South Wales, squatters can be awarded ownership if they have occupied a property for more than 12 years. The court granted Mr Gertos those rights because he had repaired and maintained the property since 1998. Australian media outlets described the case as ""bizarre"" because the relevant law is typically used by those who move into a property themselves. Mr Gertos told the Supreme Court of New South Wales that he first became curious about the house, in the suburb of Ashbury, because it was in ""disrepair"".  He said he went to the property in late 1998 and determined that it was unoccupied and uninhabitable. ""I left the property and then decided to take possession of it myself,"" he said in a court affidavit. Mr Gertos spent nearly A$150,000 on repairs and renovations before installing tenants, the court heard. But the descendants of previous owner Henry Thompson Downie, who died in 1947, launched a legal challenge last year after Mr Gertos applied for ownership. Mr Downie's relatives testified that the family had vacated the house before World War Two due to an ant infestation, after which it was rented to a sole tenant. That tenant leased the home until her death in April 1998. The family argued that Mr Gertos had not acted in an ""open"" manner, meaning he should not be able to claim ownership through squatting laws. But Justice Rowan Darke disagreed, ruling: ""Mr Gertos succeeded in taking and maintaining physical custody of the land, to the exclusion of all others.""  Mr Downie's relatives intend to appeal the decision, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported."

Hannah Sergel, from Christchurch, New Zealand, first spoke to Meghan on social media in 2016.  The pair met face to face in Auckland on Tuesday. After spotting Hannah in the crowds, Meghan rushed over to hug her. ""I was just so shocked,"" she told BBC News. ""I didn't expect her to recognise me and come over and give me a giant hug."" In pictures: Harry and Meghan's first tour She said the Duchess spotted her because she was holding a sign saying ""It's Hannah from Instagram"".  The 20-year-old waited for more than seven hours to meet Meghan on the royal couple's public walkabout at the Viaduct Harbour in Auckland.    She also gave Meghan a letter thanking her for her support, which the Duchess promised to read, Hannah added.  Hannah said she had been a fan of the actress since 2014 and Meghan helped her when she was struggling at university. ""She encouraged me to do what I love and be the best version of myself I can be,"" she said. ""I had to drop out of my course but she was still so sweet, encouraging me to keep going,"" she added.     The Duke and Duchess of Sussex visited New Zealand on the final leg of their 16-day tour. They have also been to Australia, Tonga and Fiji during their first overseas trip as a married couple. "
17,"Geoffrey Rush: Actress 'frightened' by alleged touching, court told - BBC News",http://www.bbc.com///news/world-australia-46026609,2018-10-30 18:37:04,Australia,http://www.bbc.com///news/world/australia,"An actress at the centre of a defamation case involving actor Geoffrey Rush says he ""deliberately"" touched her breast on stage, leaving her feeling ""frightened"". Eryn Jean Norvill told an Australian court that Mr Rush had also made groping gestures towards her during the production of King Lear in 2015. Mr Rush strongly denies the claims. He is suing a Sydney newspaper over stories published in 2017 which he says depicted him as a pervert. The Daily Telegraph's original report carried the headline ""King Leer"" and reported that Mr Rush, 67, had been the subject of a complaint about his behaviour during the Sydney Theatre Company production. On Tuesday Ms Norvill, who played Cordelia in the play, testified in Sydney's Federal Court as a witness for the newspaper's publisher, Nationwide News.  She accused the Oscar winner of inappropriately touching the side of her breast during a preview performance, in a scene in which he carried Cordelia's body. ""It couldn't have been an accident because it was slow and pressured,"" she told the court, adding that she had felt ""trapped"". Ms Norvill was not named in the newspaper's reports. Her testimony on Tuesday is the first time she has spoken publicly about the allegations. Speaking in court, the actress said that Mr Rush's behaviour during rehearsals had made her feel uncomfortable.  This included him allegedly making comments about her body, licking his lips, and telling her that she looked ""yummy"" and ""scrumptious"", Ms Norvill said. The actress testified that she had felt ""embarrassed"" and ""shamed"", and reluctant to speak out. ""I was at the bottom of the rung. He was at the top. His power was intimidating,"" she said. Mr Rush has vehemently rejected any allegations of inappropriate behaviour.  Last week, he told the court that he and Ms Norvill had enjoyed a ""very sparky, congenial rapport"". He had prepared for the scene in which he carried Ms Norvill across the stage by imagining his own daughter had died, the actor testified. Mr Rush is suing Nationwide News - owned by News Corp Australia - and journalist Jonathon Moran. He is seeking aggravated damages, arguing the articles significantly damaged his reputation. The publisher is standing by the stories. The trial is expected to run for another two weeks."

Passengers in the vehicles can also hit a button to ask a human operator to take control remotely if driving conditions get too challenging for their liking. Currently the drivers are mainly called upon to take control of test vehicles during trials on public roads, but they are also working on active self-driving vehicles that are being used in mines, airports and other controlled locations.  As more self-driving vehicles appear on roads around the world, it is a job that is likely to become increasingly important. “This is a new form of driving,” says Shukman, who is employed by Phantom Auto, a small company specialising in teleoperation safety technology. “But it quickly becomes second nature. At the moment professional drivers have to spend days and even weeks away from home. I see this role evolving into more of a full-time office job in the future. We can have control centres where hundreds of remote operators will come to work, close to where they live. It could totally transform the work-life balance of professional drivers.” While less than a decade ago self-driving cars may have seemed like science fiction, a number of major technology companies and car manufacturers are testing autonomous vehicles in trials on public roads around the world. Google was the first major company to begin sending robotic vehicles out on public roads around California, but traditional car firms including Ford, Jaguar Land Rover, General Motors, BMW and Volkswagen have now developed self-driving systems of their own. Other firms like Amazon, Pizza Hut and the online supermarket Ocado have been investigating using self-driving vehicles to make deliveries. But there have been setbacks too – the computer vision technology used by Tesla in its semi-autonomous technology has been implicated in at least one serious accident. Earlier this year Uber suspended its self-driving operations after an accident led to the death of a pedestrian. Most recently Apple’s self-driving car was involved in a minor accident.    While these incidents mean the industry still has significant hurdles to overcome, the momentum seems unstoppable. Between 40% and 95% of car journeys will be done in autonomous vehicles by 2030, according to different analyses. Ford says it plans to have fully autonomous vehicles with no steering wheel or accelerator on the roads as early as 2021.  Most projections suggest autonomous vehicles will lead to widespread unemployment for the millions of professional drivers who transport goods and people. According to estimates by Goldman Sachs, for example, as many as 25,000 jobs could be lost a month in the US as self-driving vehicles replace truckers, taxi drivers and public transport workers. The International Transport Forum predicts there could be a 50-70% reduction in demand for professional truck drivers in the US and Europe by 2030 due to the technology.  The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders also estimates that autonomous vehicles could result in an additional 320,000 jobs being created in the UK alone  But other analysis suggests the majority of these job losses are not likely to be felt until 2030 and will be mitigated by new job creation. Roles such as those being performed by Shukman and his colleagues will become increasingly in demand. Analysis by Uber also sees the number of trucking jobs increasing as the focus shifts from humans doing long-haul driving to local delivery. But autonomous vehicles will bring new roles too. “We expect that the transportation sector will have an increase in jobs that require directly interfacing with customers of autonomous vehicles, particularly for consumers who are older or disabled,” says Amitai Bin-Nun, vice president of autonomous vehicles and mobility innovation at the US think-tank Securing America's Future Energy. Drivers would be freed up to focus on customer service, including helping passengers in and out of vehicles, or offering them onboard services. Workers will also be needed to maintain large fleets of technologically-advanced vehicles. “It is also likely that there may be many high-skilled jobs created to develop autonomous vehicle technology and find new applications for its use,” adds Bin-Nun. Car manufacturers and other firms active in the field are already searching for those with the skills needed to put self-driving vehicles safely on public roads. While trials are underway around the world, they are still strictly controlled and require humans to sit behind the wheel, ready to step in at a moment’s notice.  According to recruitment firm ZipRecruiter, the number of job adverts in the autonomous driving sector has increased by 27% year on year, with a 250% jump in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the same time last year. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders also estimates that autonomous vehicles could result in an additional 320,000 jobs being created in the UK alone. “The industry is going to need an army of people to develop these autonomous systems,” says Graeme Smith, chief executive of Oxbotica, a UK company testing self-driving vehicles. “We will need engineers who can make them work, testing them, validating them and certifying the technology. Then we will need new product designers, as everything will be done differently compared to today if humans are not in the loop.” What Smith is referring to is the radical change in vehicle design that is likely to accompany self-driving cars. The way people interact and control their vehicles has remained largely unchanged for decades. But with pedals, gear sticks and steering wheels redundant, what will be the best way to interact with the onboard computer and tell it where you want to go?  ZipRecruiter predicts a wide range of new jobs could appear as companies start to adopt self-driving vehicles. Engineers proficient in autonomous navigation and robotics will be essential, it says, as will technicians capable of repairing vehicles that break down. “Autonomous driving is going to be at least as big as today’s engine industry,” adds Smith. The global automobile engine industry is worth around $301bn and employs around 1.6 million people. But there are some who believe that the impact of autonomous vehicles could be greater still. The World Economic Forum predicts that the automotive industry could grow by up to $144bn within the next 10 years thanks to self-driving vehicles, while a report by microchip company Intel, which is working with BMW on self-driving cars, estimates autonomous vehicles could be worth up to $7 trillion to global economies by 2050. Much of this value, according to Intel, will come from new occupations that will emerge around the self-driving car industry, delivering something it calls the “passenger economy”. This will create jobs such as managers capable of overseeing vast fleets of self-driving taxis or goods-delivery vehicles. It is something Bin-Nun agrees with. “As autonomous vehicles are likely to foster a transition to individuals travelling in vehicles owned by fleets rather than independently owned, these fleets will require programming, maintenance, consumer support and monitoring. These all represent significant opportunities for job growth at all skill-levels.”  WEF predicts that the automotive industry could grow by up to $144bn within the next 10 years thanks to self-driving vehicles   But Intel also sees jobs being created for those who can provide innovative goods and services for the newly-idle former motorists during their journeys. Demand for coffees and snacks will increase, as will the need for in-vehicle digital entertainment and even manicures while on-the-move. Then there is the need for planners, architects and engineers capable of creating the new road infrastructure that self-driving cars will need. But demand for drivers is not likely to die out any time soon either. “We want people who are experienced, expert drivers,” says Elliot Katz, chief executive of Phantom Auto, which provides remote operators for many of the leading manufacturers developing autonomous vehicles. “Autonomous vehicles in the future are not going to have any manual controls for passengers to take over with. So that is where remote operators will come in and their skills are going to be in great demand.” For Shukman, it is an unusual job that comes with a lot of responsibility. “It is fascinating and fun to be driving in a place I have never physically been to,” he says. “But at the end of the day I am responsible for the safety of the vehicle and its occupants. This focuses the mind, knowing people are relying on me.” And at the end of his shift, how does he feel about getting into his old-fashioned, manually controlled car? “Driving through this new perspective has added to my awareness on the road,” he says. “It has made me a safer driver.” -- To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.

20,BBC - Future - How fungus and sweat could transform Martian exploration,http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20181031-how-fungus-and-sweat-could-transform-martian-exploration,,Future,http://www.bbc.com/future,"In 2016, designer Liz Ciokajlo received a commission from the Museum of Modern Art (Moma) in New York: revisit the Moon Boot, a fluffy-looking snowshoe inspired by the footwear used by the Apollo astronauts. Launched in 1972 at the height of the lunar missions, the Moon Boot is an icon of the 20th Century’s ‘plastic age’ and the museum curators wanted a new take on it. Ciokajlo set out to reimagine it. She knew only a biomaterial would work in a post-plastic age, but the designer also wanted a new destination to inspire it. Our generation’s space travel obsession is not the Moon, she thought, but the red planet - Mars. And Mars allows you to really think outside of the box. “Mars has always been a place where you can dream,” Ciokajlo says. “It is a place where you can reimagine how to live on Earth.” You might also like:  The final design can be manufactured with almost only human sweat and a few fungus spores, ideal for a seven-month trip to Mars with limited check-in luggage  The commission lead her to a wondrous biomaterial that had already attracted the attention of engineers innovating in building materials and of top space agencies like Nasa and the European Space Agency (Esa). Her final design, a tall, female, rough-looking boot, can be manufactured on board a spaceship with almost only human sweat and a few fungus spores, ideal for a seven-month trip to Mars with limited check-in luggage. This magic biomaterial is mycelium, the vegetative part of the fungus. If you imagine that mushrooms are the ‘fruits’ of the fungus, mycelium could be regarded as its roots or stems. It looks like a mass of white thread-like structures, each called hyphae, which crisscross soil and other material in which fungi grows. Collectively, these threads are called mycelium and are the largest part of the fungus.   Mycelium has amazing properties. It is a great recycler, as it feeds off a substrate (like sawdust or agricultural waste) to create more material, and has the potential of almost limitless growth in the right conditions. It can endure more pressure than conventional concrete without breaking, is a known insulator and fire-retardant and could even provide radiation protection on space missions.   On Earth it’s currently used to create ceiling panels, leather, packaging materials and building materials, but in outer space it stands out for its architectural potential, says artist and engineer Maurizio Montalti, who has teamed up with Ciokajlo.   “You rely on the cells capacity to replicate themselves, thus creating more material in short time,” says Montalti. For her revisited boot, Ciokajlo wanted to use the human body as the source for some of the building materials and decided to employ sweat. Reusing perspiration is not entirely new in space exploration (the International Space Station currently reuses astronauts’ urine and sweat for drinkable water) but a novelty approach for footwear. She thinks it might make astronauts feel closer to home during the long journey to Mars.    Mycelium materials can take shape in several ways  Mycelium’s adventures in space go beyond material innovation. As she researched the commission, Ciokajlo came across a feminist novel from 1893 that imagined Mars as a planet where gender roles reversed – which is why their creation is a boot for women. The novel propelled her to imagine a new society where biomaterials provide a new way to interact with our surroundings. Even the boot’s name, Caskia, comes from the novel: it is the planet’s only region with equal standing between men and women. The design is still hypothetical, because the real boot submitted for Moma – and currently in display at the London Design Museum – did use mycelium but not human sweat, as their deadline was too tight, but the science checks out.  Mycelium materials can take shape in several ways. If you have solid waste (like sawdust), you want to sterilise it and add the fungus so its spread can start. By incubating it in controlled conditions for temperature and humidity, the white veiny hyphae would compact to create a fibrous solid material. This is how Nasa and Esa hope to use mycelium for their Mars bases. For Caskia, a special type of fungus (there are more than five million species) would feed off the nutrients diluted in human sweat after it is filtered for impurities. The ‘wet material’, as Montalti calls it, would be shaped with a mould directly around the astronaut’s feet and kept fed by sweat production. In both methods, the fungus growth can be stopped by heating to up to 70 or 80C (F), which means either using an oven on Earth or exposing the culture to high temperatures on Mars or outer space.   The substrate would possibly need an additional nutritional supplement to promote its growth, acknowledges Moltalti, but it is rooted in current mycelium science. The boot they created for MoMA used a special diluted formula. “For each of our cultural inspirations you could find scientists that back this up,” says Ciokajlo.  The European Space Agency (Esa) is likewise pushing boundaries with mycelium. In a joint project with Montalti and the University of Utrecht, the agency is exploring whether fungi could be used to grow buildings, like labs and other facilities, in space.  Launching from Earth with a fully formed Mars facility is expensive, with payload prices ranging at $10,000 (£7,700) per pound. Mining in Mars is also problematic and costly. Add that to the ever-present question of how to manage waste in space, and mycelium’s ability to decompose and recycle starts to look very promising. The team had provisional results in October and Montalti says they are encouraging (Esa is still double-checking them, so they are not yet public). The engineer dreams about combining mycelium with 3D printing or even genetic manipulation to have more options.     On our planet, many projects have used mycelium as a structural component  On the other side of the Atlantic, Nasa is also examining whether their Mars missions could grow surface structures on the planet itself. The Americans are considering producing on Earth a flexible plastic shell seeded with mycelium and then activating the fungal growth once in Mars. That way a thin film can become thick roof or walls in a matter of days or weeks. The building could be malleable: fungus growth stops when their feedstock is consumed, their ideal temperature is withdrawn or the mycelia is killed via heat, yet the dormant fungi can be reactivated into growth, if repairs are needed. One of the most appealing aspects of mycelium in relation to space architecture is the capacity of certain fungi to express melanin, a biomolecule that can shield humans from cosmic radiation. Montalti and ESA tested this property as part of their project. On our planet, many projects have used mycelium as a structural component. For instance, a collaboration between the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) used 3D printing to create a branching structure that can support a roof.  For many, mycelium provides a golden example of circular economy. Waste comes in as input for the mycelium and the resulting material is potentially biodegradable, just like wood. “Currently our materials come from extraction,” says architect Adi Reza Nugroho, from the Indonesian firm MycoTech that provided the mycelium for ETH and KIT. “Now we want to have a closed-loop cycle.” If Nasa and Esa’s experiments are successful, a small group of fungus spores could provide the starting point for a living, natural settlement on Mars. From a handful of spores, they could replicate and find dozens of uses for astronauts walking around the red planet. And if Ciokajlo and Montalti have it their way, and these humans can spare a bit of their sweat, even the shoes on their feet will start life as a fungus. -- Diego Arguedas Ortiz is a science and climate change reporter.

21,BBC - Travel - Mexico’s bread baked for spirits,http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20181030-mexicos-bread-baked-for-spirits,,Travel,http://www.bbc.com/travel,"David Roque Reyes Martínez has made pan de muerto (Day of the Dead bread) every year in his home in Oaxaca, Mexico, since he was 12 years old. Now 53, this tradition has marked his life each year in late October as Day of the Dead approaches. “It wouldn’t be Day of the Dead if there wasn’t bread,” Reyes said with a hearty laugh, followed by a more earnest expression as the idea settled in his mind.  You may also be interested in:• Kyrgyzstan’s bread that feeds the dead• Galicia’s mythic drink of blue fire• Why Romanians are obsessed with garlic Day of the Dead festivities begin on 31 October when families prepare for the return of spirits of deceased children on 1 November, known as Día de los Angelitos (Day of the Little Angels). The following day, 2 November is Día de los Muertos, Day of the Dead, when all other souls return. The nights of 31 October and 1 November, people visit cemeteries to decorate the graves of loved ones in preparation for the arrival of their spirits. Every year, beginning a few days before the celebrations, the Reyes household fills with the smell of cinnamon and anise, the aroma of the wood-burning oven, and, eventually, of freshly baked rolls, which he sells to neighbours who eagerly await it each year.  It wouldn’t be Day of the Dead if there wasn’t bread  Reyes likes to make the sweet bread at night. He enjoys the quiet time as he weighs the ingredients on his 50-year-old scales that were once used by his father, a panadero (baker) from whom Reyes first learnt to make bread. He thinks about his father as he bakes, he said, who died when Reyes was just 11 years old. The memories take not only the form of a painting of his father that will sit above an altar prepared in the last week of October, but also the form of the dough held in Reyes’ hands, which he kneads as his father taught him.  Working through the night is not without incidents, however, especially around this time of year, when it is believed by many that the dead travel back to the human world. “Do you remember the time when the bread suddenly fell off the edge here?” Reyes’ wife, María Antonia, asked her husband as she passed by the table where Reyes was preparing his ingredients, a table that was also used by his father. Reyes nodded and recounted that they were sure that it was his late father who pushed the bread onto the floor. “We said ‘stop that, old man’,” María Antonia told me with a laugh. This kind of casual conversation about death and spirits is not unusual in Mexico; and in my experience in Oaxaca, traditions around these topics are particularly strong. Every year, many families will build an altar in their home, topped with flowers, candles, water, bread and photos of their deceased loved ones. Each item has significance for guiding the dead back home: the flowers’ aroma leads spirits to the land of the living while the candles light the way. When they arrive, the bread eases their hunger and the water quenches their thirst. The favourite food and tipples of the deceased are also placed on the altar for them to enjoy upon their return.  The bread is also meant to be eaten by the living. Some families will eat the foodstuffs placed among the offerings after their ancestors have left the human world late on 2 November, but many, like Reyes, believe that the bread loses its flavour after the dead have enjoyed it. “It no longer tastes the same,” he said. “That’s where the mystical comes in. The essence [of the food] is taken away by the deceased.” Day of the Dead bread in its modern-day form cannot have been part of the pre-Hispanic traditions of honouring the dead, since many of the ingredients, most notably the wheat flour, were not found in Mexico until the arrival of the Spanish. In their book, Celebraciones Mexicanas: History, Traditions and Recipes, Andrea Lawson Gray and Adriana Almazan Lahl say that when the Spanish arrived on Mexican shores, the devout Catholics were horrified to find the practice of human sacrifice taking place. According to the book, one custom particularly disgusted the Spanish: a heart of a virgin was placed into a clay pot with amaranth before the ceremony leader took a bite of it in offering to the gods. In an attempt to eliminate this practice, the Spanish prepared a bread with a sticky, pink sugar topping – that represented blood – to be used in place of a real heart. Lawson Gray and Almazan Lahl describe how the Aztec’s “acceptance of this substitute marked the first time the Aztecs gave bread divine attributes, and the beginning of a slow transition to Catholicism.”  Now, across the country, there is a whole variety of different breads baked specifically for Day of the Dead. A fluffy, sugary white bread infused with orange essence and topped with extra dough shaped to represent bones, can be found in many areas of Mexico. In Oaxaca, however, the most common form of this bread – and the one Reyes makes – is pan de yema, a rich, sweet egg yolk-based bread. Pan de yema is sold throughout the year, but during Day of the Dead, a touch of anise and cinnamon is added for extra flavour and the bread is adorned with tiny decorative faces, or caritas. The idea in Oaxaca is that these caritas are the faces of the dead and the bread is their body. The faces are noticeably white-skinned, which Mexican food historian and chef Susana Trilling puts down to them being the representation of saints, adding another layer of syncretism. Day of the Dead, after all, overlaps with the Catholic All Saint’s Day, a link that’s clearly visible in areas like Puebla, about four hours north of Oaxaca, where some altars are adorned with white satin and Catholic iconography.  Back in Oaxaca, Reyes began to mix the ingredients on the table, getting into a rhythm generated by years of bread-making. He kneaded the bread with a punch, pull, slap, punch, pull, slap that was almost mechanical – a beat his family has heard for generations. “Because it is Day of the Dead, we have to kill the dough,” Reyes said with a chuckle and a glint in his eye as he continued to pound the mixture with an incredible strength. As we waited for the dough to proof, Reyes sat and told stories of Day of the Dead that had been told to him by his abuela, his grandmother, when he was young. One was a cautionary tale of a man who didn’t believe the dead returned to the human world. Despite his wife’s insistence, the man stubbornly refused to create an altar to his deceased parents, and instead left them two large biznaga cacti; since they weren’t really coming back, he argued that it didn’t matter what he left in offering.  The deceased don’t die as long as they remain in someone’s memory  Later that night the man was on a hilltop above the town and saw a trail of people walking together. He got closer and saw they were carrying flowers, mole and bread. Suddenly he saw his deceased mother and father struggling to carry the prickly cacti back to the afterlife. The man was distraught and ran back home to plead forgiveness, and every year after, he created a huge altar for his deceased loved ones. “Have you seen Coco?” Reyes suddenly asked as he came to the end of his story, referring to the Disney-Pixar film that came out last year. I smiled and said I had. “It is not far from the truth,” he said, talking about the message of the film. “The deceased don’t die as long as they remain in someone’s memory.”  Once the raw dough was shaped into perfectly round balls, Reyes arranged them on parchment paper in preparation for baking in his homemade wood-fired oven. The mounds varied in size, from tiny bite-size rolls to larger half-kilo rounds. “The smallest breads are for the angelitos,” Trilling explained when I asked about the different-sized loaves a few days later. As Reyes placed the rolls into the oven and closed the door, he chuckled and exclaimed, “Now we have buried the dead.”  The best thing I inherited was this knowledge  The smell of baking bread filled the air and made our mouths water. The perfectly baked caramel-brown loaves were pulled from the oven just as María Antonia finished preparing steaming Oaxacan hot chocolate. We ripped off pieces of bread and dipped them into our mugs to soak up the liquid; the cinnamon- and anise-infused, sweet rolls combined with the rich chocolate was simply delicious. “The best thing I inherited was this knowledge,” said Reyes as he popped a slice of bread into his mouth.

24,Royole's bendy-screen FlexPai phone unveiled in China - BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46048601,2018-11-01 05:50:23,Technology,http://www.bbc.com///news/technology,"A little-known California-based company has laid claim to creating the ""world's first foldable phone"". Royole Corporation - a specialist in manufacturing flexible displays - unveiled the FlexPai handset at an event in Beijing. When opened, the device presents a single display measuring 7.8in (19.8cm) - bigger than many tablets.  But when folded up, it presents three separate smaller screens - on the front, rear and spine of the device. The six-year-old company said it would hold three ""flash sales"" to consumers in China on 1 November to offer the first product run.   The phones will be priced between 8,999 and 12,999 yuan ($1,290 to $1,863; £1,011 to £1,460) depending on the memory and storage specifications selected. In addition, Royole said it would also offer a slightly different version of the devices to developers across the world the same day. It intends to start deliveries in ""late December"". The launch has caught many industry watchers by surprise.  It was widely believed Samsung or Huawei would be the first to sell such a device to the public. Samsung was expected to preview its efforts at an event in San Francisco on 7 November, but is not understood to be ready to put a product on sale.  Venturebeat reporter Evan Blass has also claimed LG intends to unveil a foldable phone of its own at the CES trade show in January. Videos posted to social media of the FlexPai in action, however, indicate the version of Android they run still needs some work. In particular, the display is shown to flick between different orientations after being switched from one mode to another before settling.  Purchasers will also need to be mindful that the device weighs 320g - more than 50% more than the iPhone XS Max or Galaxy Note 9. However, Royole says the FlexPai has been tested to withstand more than 200,000 open-and-shut movements, meaning it should offer many years of use before the action damages the picture. One expert said the smartphone was unlikely to become a bestseller but was impressive nonetheless. ""Royole gets the bragging rights to being first, and it's quite astonishing that someone you've never heard of is doing this,"" said Carolina Milanesi, from the Creative Strategies consultancy. ""What's great is that it's putting this into the hands of developers, who will be able to start the legwork that will result in apps for flexible devices that will eventually be sold by Samsung and whoever else. ""You need developers to think through how they can best take advantage of screens that double in size."" She added that Royole might ultimately become an acquisition target for one of the mainstream consumer electronics brands.  Another company-watcher added that he doubted the FlexPai would ever be produced in large numbers. ""Royole has carried out several publicity stunts over the years to showcase its flexible OLED [organic light-emitting diode] displays,"" said Dr Guillaume Chansin from Irimitech Consulting. ""The FlexPai is probably another stunt. ""Royole is building its first OLED factory and it is now trying to compete directly with other display manufacturers such as Samsung and LG."""
25,Do schools help or hinder social mobility? - BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46013665,2018-10-31 11:20:50,Business,http://www.bbc.com///news/business,"Do schools help social mobility and fairness? Or do they give even more advantages to the better-off? Even if they can't make up for all inequalities, at least we might expect them to make the playing field more level. But a major international study on social mobility from the OECD economics think tank shows a more sobering picture. Each year that a child spends in education, the gap between rich and poor grows wider. On average, across more than 60 countries, that difference between the richest and poorest is the equivalent to three years of schooling by the age of 15. Only about one in 10 children from poor backgrounds will achieve the same results at those from wealthy backgrounds. The study tracked test results taken by 10-year-olds in 1995, 15-year-olds in 2000 and then a decade later for young adults in their mid-20s. At each point the social divide, with few exceptions, tended to widen.  It's not that difficult to see how this happens.  The children of more prosperous families are travelling in an educational fast lane, with more support from home, a higher chance of getting into a good school and university, and benefiting from the interventions of better-educated parents. The accumulation of advantages will amplify differences. According to the study, on average by the age of 15 about 13% of the variation in students' performance will be determined by their social background. This varies between countries. In the UK, it's below average at 11%, with Norway and Estonia lower at 8%. In France it's 20% and in Germany and Switzerland it's 16%. But it's not all pessimism. The OECD's head of education Andreas Schleicher, argues there is also plenty of evidence to say that ""poverty need not be destiny"". There are school systems where many more disadvantaged children do well.  In countries such as Singapore, Japan and Finland, the test results of the poorest 20% are higher than the richest 20% in the Slovak Republic, Uruguay, Brazil and Bulgaria. The UK does quite well on this measure, with the median point for UK students being above the wealthiest 20% in Italy and not far behind those similarly advantaged students in Spain. ""It shows that students from very similar backgrounds can have very different outcomes,"" says Mr Schleicher. He says it's a cause for optimism that some countries have made sure that ""excellent teaching"" is available for rich and poor pupils. The study also found other factors associated with disadvantaged pupils defying the odds, including in Vietnam and China. One pattern that emerged strongly was the importance of the social profile of the school they attended. In many countries, disadvantaged students tend to be clustered together in schools with other similarly disadvantaged students. If this can be prevented, the study shows that disadvantaged students taught in schools with a wealthier intake tend to have much higher results. But the research also shows how easily inequality can be absorbed into education systems. ""A rising tide doesn't automatically lift all boats,"" says Mr Schleicher. Numbers going into university have increased - but that doesn't necessarily make it a fairer system.  In Singapore, many going to university will be the first in their families to get a degree. It's an example of social mobility and widening doors. But in Italy, wealthier families have been much more likely to benefit from extra university places, widening the education gap. In terms of ""equity"", Italy has been going backwards, says Mr Schleicher. There are also generational divides. In the US, looking at people between 26 and 65, the older age groups are much more likely than the younger ones to have advanced further in education than their parents. You can see educational mobility withering through the more recent decades. The big picture is the struggle to kick-start social mobility in Western democracies. A report earlier this year from the OECD showed that in the UK, social mobility was so frozen that it would take five generations for poorer families to reach the average income.  ""Meritocracy is the big promise of our democracies, and social mobility is the truth test for meritocracy,"" says Mr Schleicher. ""So, yes, I think we need to worry if social mobility is limited or slowing down."" He says the slowdown is not simply a case of there being many more people with higher qualifications competing with each other, because the demand for graduates and skilled workers has increased at least as rapidly. Instead he warns of a system in which social division becomes embedded. ""Lower social mobility and higher income inequality tend to go together,"" he says.  As the wealthiest families accelerate even further ahead, it's likely to even further narrow the chances for ""talented yet underprivileged individuals"" who are being left behind. ""It's a worry, because it shows our education systems have not been able to moderate social inequality. Instead social inequality has grown,"" says Mr Schleicher.

26,BBC - Culture - The 100 greatest foreign-language films: who voted?,http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20181029-the-100-greatest-foreign-language-films-who-voted,,Culture,http://www.bbc.com/culture,"We approached hundreds of film experts - critics, industry figures, academics - and 209 from 43 countries responded by filling in an online poll in August and September 2018. Each critic voted for 10 films, ranking them 1 (favourite) to 10 (10th favourite). We awarded 10 points per first ranked film, 9 per second ranked film, and so on down to 1. We then summed the points. The film with the most points won. We split ties by the total number of votes: films with more votes ranked higher. Any ties remaining after this were split by first place votes: films with more critics placing them at number one ranked higher.

43,Kanye West announces he's distancing himself from politics - BBC News,http://www.bbc.com///news/newsbeat-46041577,2018-10-31 18:48:26,Newsbeat,http://www.bbc.com///news/newsbeat,"Kanye West says he's ""distancing"" himself from politics. On Twitter the rapper claims he's being ""used to spread messages I don't believe in."" He has been a vocal supporter of President Trump but this decision appears to centre around a campaign he was linked to known as Blexit. Run by Conservative commentator Candace Owens it encourages black Americans to quit the Democratic party. She claimed the musician had designed clothing for the campaign, something which the rapper has now denied.    The rapper tweeted: ""My eyes are now wide open. I am distancing myself from politics and completely focusing on being creative.""  It seems Kanye West intends to step away from politics altogether now.   Writing to his 28.7 million followers the musician said: ""I support creating jobs and opportunities for people who need them the most. ""I support prison reform, I support common-sense gun laws that will make our world safer.  ""I support those who risk their lives to serve and protect us and I support holding people who misuse their power accountable.""  It's not the first time, the rapper, who wants to be referred to as Ye, has had to clear up his political beliefs. Earlier this year he came under fire for for saying that the 13th amendment of the US Constitution, which brought an end to slavery, should be abolished - a statement that he later clarified. Apparently he meant to write ""amend"". And his performance on the American comedy show Saturday Night Live a few weeks ago sparked outrage and amusement in equal measure. The 41-year-old, who is married to Kim Kardashian, wore a hat with Donald Trump's slogan ""Make America Great Again"" and apparently gave an unscripted, off-air rant in support of the president.  Excerpts filmed by the audience and shared on social media show the rapper discussing his support for President Trump, his pledge to run for president in 2020 and the need for a ""dialogue not a diatribe"". ""So many times I talk to a white person and [they] say, 'How could you like Trump, he's racist?'"" he said.  ""Well, if I was concerned about racism I would've moved out of America a long time ago.""  Kanye West has been very upfront about his support for President Trump. The pair have met several times discussing issues including employment and criminal justice reform. However stars including Snoop Dogg, T.I. and John Legend have criticised Kanye West for meeting the US leader.   Kanye West ended this latest series of messages saying: ""I believe in love and compassion for people seeking asylum and parents who are fighting to protect their children from violence and war."" ""I would like to thank my family, loved ones, and community for supporting my ACTUAL beliefs and my vision for a better world."" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

44,Fake Cambridge Analytica ad hits Facebook - BBC News,http://www.bbc.com///news/technology-46043578,2018-10-31 23:20:26,Technology,http://www.bbc.com///news/technology,"A fake advert purporting to have been paid for by scandal-hit Cambridge Analytica has been posted to Facebook. The ad, now removed but still visible in Facebook's new ad transparency portal, uses the logo of EU referendum campaign group BeLeave, which, in July, was found to have broken electoral law.  It calls for a new immigration policy, saying: ""Our current system is broken."" News site Business Insider confirmed to the BBC that it made the ad for a story on Facebook's advertising tools. Cambridge Analytica closed down operations in May. ""This ad was not created by Cambridge Analytica,"" a Facebook spokesman said. ""It is fake, violates our policies and has been taken down.  ""We believe people on Facebook should know who is behind the political ads they're seeing, which is why we are creating the Ads Library so that you can see who is accountable for any political ad.  ""We have tools for anyone to report suspicious activity such as this."" Jim Edwards, editor-in-chief of Business Insider UK said, ""We hope our story will push Facebook into making its advertising system more secure and less open to abuse."" The ad was spotted by Guardian and Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr. ""It just highlights how completely useless Facebook's new transparency rules are,"" she told the BBC. ""I can't think how they ever thought they were going to work - anybody can write anything in that box."" From 16 October, Facebook's new rules for political ads in the UK came into effect. The social network had claimed that creators of such ads would have to prove their identity and location. However, the resilience of Facebook's system has been called into question. News site Vice was able to post ads purporting to be paid for by every sitting US senator, a total of 100 individuals. ""Receiving approval to run an ad 'paid for' by a senator typically just took a few minutes,"" said Vice journalist William Turton. The fake ad comes as the UK and Canadian parliaments join forces to demand that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg respond to MP's questions over the Cambridge Analytica scandal. A hearing will be held by the UK House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee on 27 November. In a joint letter, the organisers appealed to Mr Zuckerberg to make an appearance. ""We would have thought that this responsibility is something that you would want to take up,"" wrote chair of the House of Commons committee Damian Collins and Bob Zimmer, chair of the Canadian standing committee on access to information, privacy and ethics."
45,Parkinson's disease 'may' start in gut - BBC News,http://www.bbc.com///news/health-46050744,2018-11-01 05:09:05,Health,http://www.bbc.com///news/health,"The brain disease Parkinson's may actually start in the depths of the digestive system, US scientists say. In their study, people whose appendix had been removed were less likely to develop the neurodegenerative disease. And the appendix, long thought of as pointless in the human body, contained the substance that kills brain cells.  Parkinson's UK said the findings were the most compelling evidence yet that the disease's origins lie outside the brain. In Parkinson's, toxic proteins build up in the brain to kill nerves, particularly those linked with movement.  It might feel counter-intuitive, but there is now growing evidence that the gut is involved.  Researchers at the Van Andel Research Institute, in Michigan, looked at data on 1.7 million people over half a century.  The study, published in Science Translational Medicine, showed the risk of Parkinson's was 20% lower in the people who had had their appendix removed.  The appendix is a little sac at the opening of the large intestine and is probably the best known vestigial (without a use) organ in the human body.  And analysing the content of people's appendixes showed they contained the same toxic protein - called alpha synuclein - that is found in the brains of Parkinson's patients.  The appendix is clearly not the whole of the story (otherwise removing it would prevent all cases). But the researchers argue the guts are a breeding ground for the protein, which then travels up the vagus nerve and into the brain.  One of the researchers, Dr Viviane Labrie, said people should not rush to have their appendix removed. She said: ""We're not advocating appendectomy as a form of protecting against Parkinson's disease.  ""It would be much more wise to control or dampen excessive formation of alpha synuclein to tune down the overabundance or potentially to prevent its escape."" The idea that the gut is involved in Parkinson's is rapidly gaining attention.  Patients often report digestive disorders, cutting the vagus nerve is linked to a lower level of Parkinson's and animal studies have suggested bacteria that live in the gut are key.  Claire Bale, from Parkinson's UK, said: ""This research is really important because it gives us some of the most compelling evidence yet that Parkinson's may begin outside the brain, which is a revolutionary new idea that is emerging in the scientific world.  ""Understanding where and how Parkinson's begins will be absolutely crucial to developing treatments that can stop it and potential prevent it altogether."" The study showed nearly everybody tested had alpha-synuclein protein in their the appendix.  And there were some differences in the structure of the protein between healthy people and Parkinson's patients.  But the hunt for the origins of Parkinson's still cannot explain why the disease develops in some people but not others.  This field of research is asking as many new questions as it answers.

46,Facebook daily visits growth slows as sales miss forecasts - BBC News,http://www.bbc.com///news/business-46038496,2018-10-31 11:02:53,Business,http://www.bbc.com///news/business,"Facebook's user growth has slowed and its revenue has missed forecasts, according to the firm's latest results. An average of 1.49 billion people used Facebook's social network on a daily basis in September, up 9% on last year but below expectations of 1.51 billion. Growth was flat in the US and Canada and fell in Europe. Facebook said sales rose by 33% to $13.7bn (£10.7bn) in the third quarter, but fell short of expectations and trailed the prior quarter's 42% gain. The company, which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, is grappling with a shift in its business as user growth slows in its most profitable markets. Growth is stalling in developed markets while an increasing amount of activity is happening via private messages or temporary ""stories"". The firm is yet to turn those features into an advertising business on the same level as the newsfeed on its original Facebook network. Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of Facebook, said he is confident that the company's advertising sales will catch up to the change in users' behaviour. However, he warned investors that 2019 would be another year of ""significant investment"". ""It will take some time,"" he said.  Facebook, which has been hit by data breaches and concerns about ""fake news"", told investors in July that growth would slow. It cited the shift in users and its own increased spending on security and privacy. During the third quarter to 30 September, Facebook said India, Indonesia and the Philippines showed the strongest gains in users. It also said that expenses increased 53% year-on-year to $7.9bn. Facebook expects revenue growth to continue to decelerate and costs to grow between 40% and 50% in 2019.  Mr Zuckerberg said expenses should begin to moderate after that but cautioned that investments in anti-hacking and abuse efforts will continue. ""I do think we are up against sophisticated adversaries who will continue to evolve so there is a large element of this that is an arms race,"" he said. ""These are not problems that you fix. These are problems that you manage over time."" Profits in the third quarter were $5.1bn, up 9% due in part to a lower-than-expected tax rate."
47,Hawaii top court approves controversial Thirty Meter Telescope - BBC News,http://www.bbc.com///news/world-us-canada-46046864,2018-11-01 02:55:59,US & Canada,http://www.bbc.com///news/world/us_and_canada,"Hawaii's Supreme Court has approved construction of what will be one of the world's largest single telescopes, on the controversial site of Mauna Kea. Work on the $1.4bn (£1bn) Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) had paused in 2015 after protests from some native Hawaiians, to whom the land is sacred. The state's top court ruled 4-1 in favour of the scientists on Tuesday. Mauna Kea already has 13 telescopes; activists say their construction has interfered with cultural practices. For years, protesters - including some environmentalists - have said building what is planned to be the world's biggest telescope on a site already saturated with observatories would further desecrate and pollute the sacred mountain. On Tuesday, Hawaii's Governor David Ige thanked the top court for its ruling in a statement, saying he believes the decision is ""fair"".  ""We're pleased the court carefully considered and weighed all the varied and passionate testimony about TMT,"" he said.  ""We believe this decision is fair and right and will continue to keep Hawai'i at the forefront of astronomy."" KAHEA, a Hawaiian-environmental group involved in the case, said they were ""disappointed"" by the decision as it ""wrongly relies"" on assumptions that there is no evidence of cultural practices on the land. The TMT is a joint effort between scientific institutions in the US, Canada, China, Japan and India. Mauna Kea, located on Hawaii's Big Island, is managed by the University of Hawaii. There are currently no legal limits to telescope construction on the site. But protests erupted when TMT construction was to begin. In April 2015, protesters blocked access roads to prevent crews from accessing the site and were arrested. Game of Thrones actor Jason Momoa, who is of Hawaiian descent, was among those speaking out against construction.  That year, the state's Supreme Court rescinded the 2011 building permit as it had been issued without letting opponents state their case. In 2016, TMT's board suggested that they might move the project to the Canary Islands, Spain, instead, but last year, Hawaii's Board of Land and Natural Resources approved a new permit. The  Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA), an agency that handles native issues, also issued a civil complaint against the university, the land board and the telescope board. The complaint said the university ""failed to meet its responsibilities"". ""At the expense of the mountain's pristine environment and cultural significance, [the university] has chosen to aggressively develop the summit of Mauna Kea for the benefit of astronomical institutions around the world."" But Tuesday's Supreme Court ruling has upheld the new permit.  Construction on the telescope can now legally proceed, though the decision also mandates that the state ensure attention is paid to cultural protocols. Henry Yang, chair of the TMT international board, said in a statement that his group was ""grateful"" and would ""honour"" Hawaii's culture. Opposition to construction in general atop Mauna Kea has existed for decades as many indigenous Hawaiians consider it the most sacred mountain. But for scientists, cloud-free skies, low atmospheric water vapour and other conditions make it among the best sites in the world for astronomy. Mauna Kea is technically ""ceded land"", the legal term for native Hawaiian lands that indigenous leaders relinquished to the US when the territory was forcibly annexed.  The plans for the telescope include, unsurprisingly, a 30m-wide mirror, making it three times as wide as the largest currently existing visible-light telescope in the world. Using the TMT, astronomers hope to investigate the universe's ""dark ages"", when the first sources of light were created, galaxies and black holes, as well as planet formation. According to the group, the telescope ""will be the largest ground-based observatory in the world and will provide new observational opportunities in essentially every field of astronomy and astrophysics"".

49,Why did the council 'house' me in a tent? - BBC News,http://www.bbc.com///news/stories-46020530,2018-10-30 12:15:42,Stories,http://www.bbc.com///news/stories,"Theo had just turned 17 when he became homeless. He turned to the council for help - but was given only a one-man tent, writes the BBC's Emma Forde.  It was August 2016 when Theo's mum, Rose, received a phone call from Cornwall Council that made her feel physically ill. Her son had moved down south to spend time with his dad, but things hadn't been going well. Theo had been kicked out of school. He'd been arrested for dealing drugs and assaulting his dad. Now he'd been evicted from supported accommodation - again because of drugs. But still, Rose was taken aback by what the council had to say. ""The manager of the team phoned me up. She said, 'Oh we've got an alternative for Theo, we're going to be putting him in a tent.' I was at work at the time and there was lots of going on around me and I just remember the moment. I felt sick. And I said, 'Well how is that even possible? How is it legal? Even you know he's so vulnerable in a tent. He's not well. I do not give you my permission for my child to be placed here.'"" The council ignored Rose's objection and one of its staff went round to pick up Theo in a car. ""They were like, 'Load the car up with your bags, we're going to a campsite,'"" remembers Theo. ""I was like, 'What? Why are we going there?' I was saying, 'How long am I going to be there? What's it going to be like?' ""And they were like, 'Oh, only for a few days until the council finds you somewhere to live.' ""And they were like, 'We've got you a tent!' ""I didn't really know what to say, I couldn't say no. They gave me the tent and drove off. ""I was pretty depressed at that point. I tried putting it up on my own. Luckily, this random guy started helping me put up the tent because he saw I couldn't.""  Months earlier, the council had been expressing concern about Theo's mental health and drug use. Officials produced an assessment which found he was at risk of ""overdose, addiction and potentially death"". Being homeless wasn't likely to improve things. The day before it gave him the tent, the council had offered Theo the option of another place in supported accommodation, but it was more than 30 miles away, so he'd turned it down, not wanting to leave the area he knew and where he was attending college. Faced with the prospect of living in a one-man tent, though, he appealed again to be housed. This time he was told his behaviour made the likelihood ""remote"". Theo was given food vouchers, credit for a mobile phone and a torch. He had a sleeping bag but no chair to sit on and no cooking equipment. Listen to My Homeless Son on Radio 4's File on 4 at 20:00 on Tuesday 30th October Or catch up later online Trying to make the best of it, he bedded down for the night. ""It was a campsite in the middle of the woods. Very spooky. I remember hearing rustling in the bushes and I thought, 'Someone's there. I'm not going out of the tent,'"" he says. ""I didn't get much sleep."" Theo was determined to keep going to college but it wasn't easy. In the morning he would go to the shower block for a cold shower, and then walk for an hour to college. At night he would suspend a torch from a strap in the tent to do his college work. He was only at that campsite for a short time before he was moved to another - it wasn't clear to him why. But at the new campsite people were kind to him, he says. One man used to make him a bacon sandwich in the morning.   Theo's mum, Rose, was desperate. She lived hundreds of miles away and was fostering some young children. But when she got the call she travelled to Cornwall, staying in a caravan near her son and imploring the council to provide him with proper accommodation. She was rebuffed. On one occasion the council told her that Theo needed to take ""some responsibility for his behaviour"" - a reference to his drug abuse, perhaps, or to his refusal to accept accommodation in a distant town. It wasn't long before that council officials had expressed concern that Theo might become addicted, overdose or die. Now children's services sent a referral to the council's housing department, which still described him as ""extremely vulnerable"", but went on to say that his ""options with the local authority are limited due to his behaviour"". These options would only increase, the referral said, ""if he can evidence he wants to make some changes"".  Around this time, Theo was found in an abandoned building, where he had set fire to a mattress to keep warm. The fire brigade came out and he was returned to the campsite by police.   Theo remembers one night in the tent when there was a violent storm. ""It was real bad. I thought my tent was going to go over so I was constantly in my tent,"" he says. ""Loads of wind, torrential rain and all my stuff got wet. Everything was wet. Even I was wet when I woke up."" People on the campsite helped Theo patch up his tent and he told council staff it was leaking.  The council's response? To buy him another tent. ""It's pretty mind blowing. I thought it would be for a day or two and then I'd get housed,"" says Theo. ""But it ended up months. It was a pretty traumatic experience for me because I've always lived in a house somewhere. They should have done so much more. They should have put me somewhere with a roof over my head."" Towards the end of August, the council did make an attempt to find Theo a place in supported accommodation, but without success. It also said it could take him into care, but that idea didn't appeal to him. Rose had been forced to return home with her husband and foster children, but she continued to travel down to Cornwall at regular intervals, desperate to help her son. ""I was back and forward every weekend where I could. I felt ill all the time, tired, exhausted emotionally drained, just barely able to function really,"" she says. At one point, Theo started sleeping in the entrance of some specialist housing for 16- and 17-year-olds, hoping for a place there.   And then, after he'd spent five weeks living in a tent, social workers suddenly decided it was no longer safe - the risk of him being sexually exploited, or coming to harm from alcohol and drugs, was too great. So he was moved from a tent… to a caravan. ""Then I got accommodation in this caravan. I felt like people were watching me through the windows. There was a lock on the door, but I made sure like all the windows were closed when I went to sleep,"" Theo remembers. He was walking home one night when a man stopped and offered him a lift. He then took the teenager to a dark car park where he sexually assaulted him. Afterwards he dropped him off at the caravan. Theo spent a further month in the caravan, petrified that the man might return. ""I always had to be out at night time. I was worried because he knew where I lived,"" he says. Theo reported the assault but social care records show no evidence that the council even considered whether to take any action to protect him in the light of it. By October, Theo's condition was rapidly deteriorating - his drug use was out of control and he was threatening to kill himself. On 7 October he was finally found a place in some supported accommodation, run by a housing association that helps homeless young people. But he was only there for a few weeks. By then it was clear he was very unwell. He was experiencing psychosis, hearing voices and needed specialist help. He was detained under the Mental Health Act and went on to spend 11 months in a psychiatric hospital. Eventually, Rose's complaints about the treatment her son received were investigated by the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman for England, Michael King.  He says the council failed to properly consider the risks Theo faced. ""This is one of the most extreme cases I've seen in 14 years in the Ombudsman's service,"" he told the BBC. ""It's deeply shocking both in terms of the impact it's had on that young man but also in terms of the depth of the failure. What we found was that the council offered him accommodation once.  When he refused it, they didn't question whether that was a legitimate decision. He asked for help and asked for accommodation. The council didn't offer it to him. When they did offer him accommodation, they accommodated him in a tent for five weeks, they accommodated him in a static caravan for four weeks and he ended up sleeping rough for a period of time. None of that is acceptable."" He added: ""What we saw in the council's records was them taking a moral judgement and blaming [Theo] for some of the choices he'd made... And it's incumbent on the local authority to actually step in and help in that situation and take the bigger view. ""He was homeless and he had a history of mental health problems and he was very vulnerable. He reported sexual assault, reported loneliness, he reported suicidal feelings. I mean, there was warning sign after warning sign, which the council should have acted on."" Jack Cordery, Service Director for Children and Family Services for Cornwall Council acknowledges that the care provided to Theo fell short. ""We're completely accepting that the services that this young man received and his mother actually were well below what we would expect. There's nobody, certainly not me who thinks that a tent on the best campsite in the world is suitable accommodation for a young person in that situation,"" he told the BBC. ""What they hoped is that that would be for a very short period and that they would be able to get him into suitable accommodation. If a young person is refusing the offer of accommodation, it closes down those options really, really quickly,"" he says. ""What I would say to Theo is that I will do everything in my power and in my authority to make sure this never happens again."" The council has since apologised to Theo and his mother. Now 19 years old, Theo is taking things one day at a time. He's looking forward to getting settled somewhere permanent and resuming his college course.  But he wants to make sure that no-one else goes through what he did. ""Young people's homelessness, it's always gonna happen, but I want it to be sorted out quickly. I'm not just here to do my sob story. I just don't want it to happen to anyone else to be honest.""

50,BBC - Capital - The people changing retirement with side hustles,http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20181024-the-people-changing-retirement-with-side-hustles,,Capital,http://www.bbc.com/capital,"When 66-year-old Londoner Sylvia Haller was laid off in February, it wasn’t just her income that took a hit. It was her self-esteem. “I had this feeling like, ‘I’m too old,’” she says. “‘Nobody wants to employ me anymore.’” She’d taken pride in her work installing home improvements for elderly and disabled residents in Hackney. Losing that job was “pretty traumatic”. But Haller’s pension was small and she wasn’t ready to retire. So she pulled herself together and began wading through online classifieds. But, she says, “I didn’t feel confident enough to go and apply for anything.” When a friend told her about TaskRabbit, an app that allows workers to hawk all kinds of services – hands-on jobs like assembling furniture or sillier tasks like waiting in line for novelty breakfast foods – she was intrigued. She set up an account on her phone – it took her a while to get the hang of the platform – and lined up customers for a variety of different jobs.  Opting in The ‘gig economy’ has exploded in recent years. Companies including the Berlin-based Delivery Hero, which hires drivers to drop off food across Europe, Asia and Latin America; Didi Chuxing, a carpooling app so powerful in China it toppled Uber’s attempt at expansion; and TaskRabbit are upending the relationship between employees and employers, and changing the composition of a day’s work.  In a 2018 trend report, researchers at Deloitte estimate 77 million people within Europe, India, and the United States formally identify themselves as freelancers. In the US alone, 3.7 million Americans were working on-demand in 2016; an updated forecast from Intuit and Emergent Research suggests that this number will surge to 9.2 million in 2021. And research by Kelly Outsourcing & Consulting Group suggests that the gig economy is also booming in the Asia Pacific region, where 84% of hiring managers say they employ gig workers. For most of those workers, freelancing is a choice: only a small minority – 11% – of the more than 6,000 workers in the Intuit study said they were unable to find full-time jobs. They opted into the gig economy in the hope of exerting more control over their careers and, in an unpredictable, ever-changing economy, diversifying the sources of their income. Finding meaning Gig work is often portrayed as a young person’s game – the purview of indecisive millennials who can’t commit to a ‘real’ career path or who graduated into the recession and never landed a full-time job. At the least, on-demand work seems to require a degree of energy and technological savvy typically associated with youth.  But almost one-third – 31% – of Americans who work exclusively in the gig economy are baby boomers, born between 1946 and 1965. That distribution isn’t unique to the US (although it hasn’t been as extensively studied worldwide). Researchers at McKinsey Global Institute, in a report which included Spain, Germany, France, Sweden, the UK and the US, found that more than three-quarters of the independent work force was 25 or older. Many are discovering that they don’t have enough money to stop working when they expected to; according to the Intuit and Emergent report, about half of American baby boomers have less than $100,000 in retirement funds.  Almost one-third – 31% – of Americans who work exclusively in the gig economy are baby boomers, born between 1946 and 1965.  But their motives are more than monetary. Boomers in the work force – compared to millennials and Gen X-ers – were least likely to be struggling financially and most likely to say they enjoyed their work. Among those 55 and older, 32% said they were compelled, at least in part, by a desire to be around “interesting people” (compared to just 15% of workers overall). “To not know what kind of client you’re going to meet – it’s quite exciting,” says Haller. She recalls assembling a bedframe for a young fashion student, whose flat “in the deepest east London”, accessible only by “small cobbled roads” and “black iron stairs”, ­ was littered with “sewing machines, lots of fabrics and clothes everywhere”. Haller and her peers are onto something profound. According to Sigmund Freud, meaningful work is one of the two prerequisites of a happy life. (The other is love.) Our jobs can help us connect with our communities, feel a sense of fulfilment and even extend our lives; some researchers suggest a link between early retirement and early death.  Catching a second wind For boomers who worked in physically demanding fields, digital gig work can be a relief. Jerry Nelson, who lives in Argentina, loved being a photojournalist. But at 62, he says he’s “too old to charge into oak trees [and] hang out with drug cartels... My bones just aren't as strong.” Instead, he writes blog posts and marketing copy for clients he finds through Fiverr, a Tel Aviv-based platform that connects freelance workers with clients all over the world. “It’s been a phenomenal year,” Nelson says. “I don't have to maintain a website. I don't have to scrape and scratch for clients.” The flexible schedule afforded by gig work may be especially appealing to boomers with family commitments. By using TaskRabbit Haller managed to keep her income stable, though she spends less time working – instead of clocking in from 08:00 to 17:00, she does “two hours here, three there, the odd Saturday. It gives me a lot more time to be home,” she says. “I’ve got two teenage boys. I’m quite glad I have more time for them.”  “The things I was doing in oil and gas and real estate – I could do them well, but they didn’t feed my spirit. It was very competitive, very stressful. At a certain point, I said, ‘I want to try something different.’”  For other boomers, gig work is a way to finally pursue their passions. American Dan Hays, 68, spent most of his career in the oil and gas industries. In 2015, he had a fateful phone conversation with a client who complimented his voice – a smooth baritone with subtle Texas twang – and suggested he’d be good at voiceovers. Hays signed up for Fiverr and booked his first voiceover acting job. “The things I was doing in oil and gas and real estate – I could do them well, but they didn’t feed my spirit. It was very competitive, very stressful. At a certain point, I said, ‘I want to try something different.’” Hays has since expanded his Fiverr offerings to freelance copywriting and scriptwriting. “I’ve been a writer since I was a kid,” he said, “and I love writing.” Now, he spends only about 10 to 15 hours per week working. When he feels like he’s reached a good stopping point, he does “whatever suits my fancy”. When we spoke on a Thursday afternoon, he said: “I’m about to go out to the dog park and play with the dogs, and then I’m going to watch a football game.” Maybe we all want the same thing after all.

51,Can we predict when and where a crime will take place? - BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46017239,2018-10-30 11:03:06,Business,http://www.bbc.com///news/business,"The new crime-fighting weapon of choice for a growing number of police forces around the world isn't a gun, a taser or pepper spray - it's data. But can computer algorithms really help reduce crime? Imagine a gang of bank robbers arriving at their next heist, only to find an armed response unit already waiting on the corner.  Or picture walking down a dark alley and feeling afraid, then seeing the reassuring blue lights of a police car sent to watch over you.  Now imagine if all of this became possible thanks to mathematics.  Ever since the Philip K Dick novel The Minority Report, which was later turned into a Tom Cruise blockbuster, was published in the 1950s, futurists and philosophers have grappled with the concept of ""pre crime"".  It's the idea that we can predict when an offence is going to occur and take measures to prevent it.  Now artificial intelligence and machine learning mean this concept has leapt straight from the pages of science fiction into the real world.  Tech firm PredPol - short for predictive policing - claims its data analytics algorithms can improve crime detection by 10-50% in some cities.  It takes years of historic data, including the type, location and time of crime, and combines this with lots of other socio-economic data, which is then analysed by an algorithm originally designed to forecast earthquake aftershocks.  The software tries to predict where and when specific crimes will occur over the next 12 hours, and the algorithm is updated every day as new data comes in. ""PredPol was inspired by experiments run by the University of California in collaboration with the Los Angeles Police Department,"" says PredPol co-founder and anthropology professor Jeff Brantingham. ""That study demonstrated that algorithmically driven forecasts could predict twice as much crime and, when used in the field, prevent twice as much crime as existing best practice."" Predictions are displayed on a map using colour-coded boxes, each one representing a 500 sq ft (46 sq m) area. Red boxes are classed as ""high risk"" and officers are encouraged to spend at least 10% of their time there.   Prof Brantingham says machine learning allows PredPol to analyse data, draw conclusions and make connections between large amounts of data that human analysts simply could not cope with. Sceptics say this is pseudoscience, because crunching crime data to make informed decisions on police deployment is nothing new.  Many forces have traditionally used ""hot spot analysis"", where past offences are recorded and overlaid onto a map, with officers concentrating on those areas.  But PredPol and others working in this space, such as Palantir, CrimeScan and ShotSpotter Missions, say that traditional hot spot analysis is just reacting to what happened yesterday, not anticipating what will happen tomorrow. AI and machine learning can spot patterns we've never noticed before. ""Machine learning provides a suite of approaches to identifying statistical patterns in data that are not easily described by standard mathematical models, or are beyond the natural perceptual abilities of the human expert,"" says Prof Brantingham. Alexander Babuta, of the National Security and Resilience Studies group at the Royal United Services Institute, agrees, saying: ""Retrospective hotspot mapping does not distinguish between two types of 'risky' locations, those that simply experience a high volume of crime over time because they are more attractive to criminals, such as insecure car parks and busy shopping areas, and areas where the likelihood of crime has been temporarily increased due to crime events that have recently occurred.  ""But machine learning predictive policing technology does.""  Police forces certainly seem to be buying in to the idea.   More than 50 police departments across the US use PredPol software, as well as a handful of forces in the UK. Kent Constabulary, for example, says street violence fell by 6% following a four-month trial. ""We found that the model was just incredibly accurate at predicting the times and locations where these crimes were likely to occur,"" says Steve Clark, deputy chief of Santa Cruz Police Department. ""At that point, we realised we've got something here.""  But predictive policing has its critics. Frederike Kaltheuner, data programme lead at civil rights group Privacy International, wonders whether it will also be used to predict police violence and white collar crime, or simply used against communities that she says are already marginalised.  ""We're moving away from innocent until proven guilty towards a world where people are innocent until found suspicious by opaque and proprietary systems that can be difficult, if not impossible, to challenge,"" she says.  There are also concerns about racial and other biases hidden within the datasets. The Los Angeles Police Department, which has been working with Palantir for its predictive policing project, has attracted criticism from local activist groups worried about threats to civil liberties and racial profiling. Rand Corporation, a policy research institution, has produced a number of studies looking at predictive policing.  More Technology of Business  Rand analyst John Hollywood says recent advances in analytical techniques have produced only ""small, incremental"" improvements in crime prediction; results that are 10-25% more accurate than traditional hot spot mapping.  ""Current technologies are not much more accurate than traditional methods,"" he says.  ""It is enough to help improve deployment decisions, but is far from the popular hype of a computer telling officers where they can go to pick up criminals in the act."" More data, from surveillance cameras equipped with image and behaviour recognition, and sensors detecting gunshot and intrusion, should help improve the accuracy of predictive techniques, he argues.  Citizens need to decide whether a reduction in crime is worth the potential assault on our civil liberties should such technology be misused or abused by those in power."

It is only the third time a parade like this has been held in Mexico's capital.  It was launched in 2016, inspired by a similar scene set in the city in the James Bond film Spectre. Organisers hoped the parade would serve as a tourist attraction for visitors looking to witness local celebrations. This year the parade was themed around migration. The city's government dedicated the parade to migrants who have lost their lives in transit, at a time when thousands from across Central America are currently travelling in a caravan through the country.  One part of the parade had people carrying parts of a border wall, which said (in Spanish): ""On this side there is also a dream."" Día de Muertos is usually held on 2 November and is a time when families honour deceased loved ones in the belief their souls return to earth to be with them.  People celebrate it in different ways across Mexico's regions, and customs can vary from family to family. Some honour their loved ones with candles, their favourite foods and floral tributes in cemeteries, while others build shrines in their own homes.   Skull imagery, costumes and body paint may also play a part - and these have become the iconic Day of the Dead images that have been exported around the world at Halloween time.  Catrina figures, which have a skeleton appearance and formal dress, featured prominently in Saturday's parade.  Despite the drizzly conditions, thousands attended the Mexico City event, which was also broadcast on television.  Local media report that 1,200 volunteers took part in the spectacle of colour, costume and music.  The parade acknowledged the region's past, including Aztec traditions like human sacrifice, and the migration routes of the early inhabitants of Central America. Significant Mexican cultural figures, including singer Chavela Vargas and artist Frida Kahlo, were also honoured at the event. A similar parade was also held in the city of Guadalajara, in western Mexico. Organisers were expecting thousands of spectators at the event, which also had live music, artists and jugglers taking part.  In Los Angeles, California, people also dressed up in Day of the Dead-inspired costumes for the 19th annual event held in the famous Hollywood Forever cemetery. All images copyright. "
53,In pictures: Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2018 - BBC News,http://www.bbc.com///news/in-pictures-45978380,2018-10-29 11:53:35,In Pictures,http://www.bbc.com///news/in_pictures,"The winners of the Royal Observatory Greenwich's annual photography competition have been announced, with first place going to an image of a dramatic landscape below the Milky Way. American photographer Brad Goldpaint won both the overall award, Insight Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2018, and the People and Space category. Taken in Moab, Utah, Goldpaint's Transport the Soul depicts immense red rock formations below the Milky Way on the right, and the distant Andromeda galaxy on the left.  Goldpaint beat thousands of amateur and professional photographers from around the globe to secure the £10,000 top prize. Competition judge Will Gater said, ""For me this superb image is emblematic of everything it means to be an astrophotographer; the balance between light and dark, the contrasting textures and tones of land and sky and the photographer alone under a starry canopy of breathtaking scale and beauty."" Runner-up: Andrew Whyte (UK) with Living Space Taken in Pagham, West Sussex, Whyte's photograph aims to show how accustomed we have become to the loss of night sky views because of light pollution, with the unlit street lamps allowing for awe-inspiring views. Winner: Nicolas Lefaudeux (France) with Speeding on the Aurora Lane A hazy auroral band is seen drifting across the sky above Sirkka, Finland, seeming like a road disappearing over the horizon. Runner-up: Matthew James Turner (UK) with Castlerigg Stone Circle Turner's image depicts standing stones illuminated by moonlight, while auroras beyond the mountains gives the appearance that the hills are emitting an ethereal green glow.  Winner: Steven Mohr (Australia) with NGC 3521, Mysterious Galaxy  The spiral galaxy NGC 3521 is located around 26 million light years away in the constellation Leo, with enormous amounts of surrounding dust and stray stars glowing far out from its disk.  Ageing yellow-red stars, younger blue-white stars burning aggressively, and various nebulae throughout the disk provide a bright array of contrasting colour tones. This image comprises approximately 20.5 hours of exposure time with various filters. Runner-up: Raul Villaverde Fraile (Spain) with From Mirach This photograph is a mosaic of 24 images and depicts the galaxies Messier 31 and Messier 33 either side of the star Mirach.  Winner: Jordi Delpeix Borrell (Spain) with Inverted Colours of the boundary between Mare Serenitatis and Mare Tranquilitatis Inverting colours is a legacy of deep sky imaging, where faint detail of galaxies and nebulae can sometimes be clearer in a negative image. Imaging the Moon in this way can help to reveal otherwise barely detectable soil features, such as ray systems.  Runner-up: Peter Ward (Australia) with Earth Shine During a total solar eclipse the brightness of the solar corona hides details of the Moon.  However, by layering multiple digital exposures - from two seconds to 1/2000th of a second - Ward's image shows the brilliant solar corona as well as the face of the Moon, illuminated by sunlight reflecting off the Earth. Winner: Nicolas Lefaudeux (France) with Sun King, Little King, and God of War This image shows the solar corona during a total solar eclipse above Unity, Oregon, US.  The eclipsing sun is flanked on the left by the blue star Regulus and the red planet Mars on the right.  More than 120 individual images were used, with a total exposure duration of 100 seconds. Runner-up: Stuart Green (UK) with Coloured Eruptive Prominence In this image, the photographer managed to capture an eruptive prominence only hours after a massive solar flare. Presented in an inverted format and colour enhanced to create a warm sunny glow, the photograph shows the beautiful structure within the hydrogen chromosphere.  Winner: Martin Lewis (UK) with The Grace of Venus Lewis captured this infrared image of Venus using a monochrome digital video camera mounted on a reflector telescope.  The video was processed to remove blurring caused by Earth's atmosphere and the frames were combined to create a single still image of the planet.  Runner-up: Martin Lewis (UK) with Parade of the Planets Martin photographed every planet in our solar system from his own back garden in St Albans, Hertfordshire.  Mercury, Uranus and Neptune required infrared imaging to bring out surface details and were colourised to match their more normal visual appearance.  All images are displayed at the same relative size that they would appear through a telescope. Winner: Ferenc Szemar (Hungary) with Circumpolar Colourful star trails are brought together with glowing city lights in Galyateto, Hungary.  This extremely long capture sequence shows the circumpolar star Almach, also known as Gamma Andromedae, just touching the horizon. Runner-up: Chuanjin Su (China) with Eclipsed Moon Trail  This image shows a spectacular total lunar eclipse seen from Zhangjiakou, Hebei Province, China.  The photographer set his camera for a four-hour stack exposure, capturing an image that reflects the changes of the Moon's colour and brightness before, during and after the eclipse.  Winner: Mario Cogo (Italy) with Corona Australis Dust Complex Under the dark Namibian sky, the photographer set his camera to a six-hour exposure in order to capture the CrA Molecular Complex, a large, dark and irregular area in the northern part of Corona Australis. Runner-up: Mario Cogo (Italy) with Rigel and the Witch Head Nebula The Witch Head Nebula is a very faint molecular gas cloud that is illuminated by supergiant star Rigel, the seventh brightest star of the sky and the brightest star in the constellation of Orion. Winner: Fabian Dalpiaz (Italy, aged 15) with Great Autumn Morning On an early Monday morning before taking an exam at school, the photographer decided to go out and take some images.  Shooting on a 50mm lens, Dalpiaz captured this incredible photograph of a meteor passing over the Dolomites in Italy.  Runner-up: Logan Nicholson (Australia, aged 13) with The Eta Carinae Nebula The Eta Carina Nebula, or NGC 3372, is the biggest and brightest nebula in the sky and is located in the constellation Carina.  To create this image, the photographer stacked and processed multiple shots.  Winner: Tianhong Li (China) with Galaxy Curtain Call Performance This was the last opportunity in 2017 to see the silver core of the Milky Way before it sunk below the horizon in Ming'antu, China. The image is stitched together from a total of 20 pictures. Winner: Damian Peach (UK) with Two Comets with the Pleiades This image showcases a very rare conjunction of two bright comets passing the Pleiades star cluster; Comet C/2017 O1 (ASASSN) is on the far left while C2015 ER61 (PanSTARRS) is in the centre. To capture this image, the photographer used a remote telescope located in Mayhill, New Mexico. All photographs courtesy Insight Astronomy Photographer of the Year, Royal Observatory Greenwich.  "
